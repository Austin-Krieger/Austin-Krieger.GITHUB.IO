        <h2>Core Java Questions</h2>
        <h3>Explain JDK, JRE and JVM?</h3>
        <p>JDK (Java Development Kit): The tool necessary to compile, document and package Java programs.</p>
        <p>JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Refers to the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.</p>
        <p>JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.</p>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <td>JRE (Java Runtime Environment)</td>
                <td>Used to run Java applications/programs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>JDK (Java Development Kit)</td>
                <td>Used to develop Java applications/programs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</td>
                <td>Interpret the byte codes and performs the execution on it</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>Explain public static void main(String args[]) in Java</h3>
        <p>main() in Java is the entry point for any Java program.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>public: Public is an access modifier, which is used to specify who can access this method. Public means that this Method will be accessible by any Class.</li>
            <li>static: It is a keyword in java which identifies it is class-based. main() is made static in Java so that it can be accessed without creating the instance of a Class. In case, main is not made static then the compiler will throw an error as main() is called by the JVM before any objects are made and only static methods can be directly invoked via the class. </li>
            <li>void: It is the return type of the method. Void defines the method which will not return any value.</li>
            <li>main: It is the name of the method which is searched by JVM as a starting point for an application with a particular signature only. It is the method where the main execution occurs.</li>
            <li>String args[]: It is the parameter passed to the main method.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why Java is platform independent?</h3>
        <p>Java is called platform independent because of its byte codes which can run on any system irrespective of its underlying operating system.</p>
        <h3>Why Java is not 100% Object-oriented?</h3>
        <p>Java is not 100% Object-oriented because it makes use of eight primitive data types such as boolean, byte, char, int, float, double, long, short which are not objects.</p>
        <h3>What are wrapper classes in Java?</h3>
        <p>Wrapper classes convert the Java primitives into the reference types (objects). Every primitive data type has a class dedicated to it. These are known as wrapper classes because they “wrap” the primitive data type into an object of that class.</p>
        <h3>What are constructors in Java?</h3>
        <p>In Java, constructor refers to a block of code which is used to initialize an object. It must have the same name as that of the class. Also, it has no return type and it is automatically called when an object is created.</p>
        <h3>What is singleton class in Java and how can we make a class singleton?</h3>
        <p>Singleton class is a class whose only one instance can be created at any given time, in one JVM. A class can be made singleton by making its constructor private.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between equals() and == in Java?</h3>
        <p>Equals() method is defined in Object class in Java and used for checking equality of two objects defined by business logic.</p>
        <p>“==” or equality operator in Java is a binary operator provided by Java programming language and used to compare primitives and objects. When comparing objects it only compare the memory locations of each.</p>
        <h3>What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Features</th>
                <th>Stack</th>
                <th>Heap</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Memory</td>
                <td>Stack memory is used only by one thread of execution.</td>
                <td>Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Access</td>
                <td>Stack memory can’t be accessed by other threads.</td>
                <td>Objects stored in the heap are globally accessible.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Memory Management</td>
                <td>Follows LIFO manner to free memory.</td>
                <td>Memory management is based on the generation associated with each object.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Lifetime</td>
                <td>Exists until the end of execution of the thread.</td>
                <td>Heap memory lives from the start till the end of application execution.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Usage</td>
                <td>Stack memory only contains local primitive and reference variables to objects in heap space.</td>
                <td>Whenever an object is created, it’s always stored in the Heap space.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is a package in Java? List down various advantages of packages.</h3>
        <p>Packages in Java, are the collection of related classes and interfaces which are bundled together. By using packages, developers can easily modularize the code and optimize its reuse. Also, the code within the packages can be imported by other classes and reused.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Packages help in avoiding name clashes</li>
            <li>They provide easier access control on the code</li>
            <li>Packages can also contain hidden classes which are not visible to the outer classes and only used within the package</li>
            <li>Creates a proper hierarchical structure which makes it easier to locate the related classes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why pointers are not used in Java?</h3>
        <p>Java doesn’t use pointers because they are unsafe and increases the complexity of the program. JVM is responsible for implicit memory allocation, thus in order to avoid direct access to memory by the user,  pointers are discouraged in Java.</p>
        <h3>What is JIT compiler in Java?</h3>
        <p>The JIT compiler compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute.</p>
        <p>JIT stands for Just-In-Time compiler in Java. It is a program that helps in converting the Java bytecode into instructions that are sent directly to the processor. By default, the JIT compiler is enabled in Java and is activated whenever a Java method is invoked. The JIT compiler then compiles the bytecode of the invoked method into native machine code, compiling it “just in time” to execute. Once the method has been compiled, the JVM summons the compiled code of that method directly rather than interpreting it. This is why it is often responsible for the performance optimization of Java applications at the run time.</p>
        <h3>What are access modifiers in Java?</h3>
        <p>In Java, access modifiers are special keywords which are used to restrict the access of a class, constructor, data member and method in another class.</p>

        <h3>Define a Java Class.</h3>
        <p>The Blueprint for an Object.</p>
        <p>A class in Java is a blueprint which includes all your data.  A class contains fields (variables) and methods to describe the behavior of an object.</p>
        <h3>What is an object in Java and how is it created?</h3>
        <p>An object is a real-world entity that has a state and behavior. An object has three characteristics:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>State</li>
            <li>Beahvior</li>
            <li>Identity</li>
        </ol>
        <p>An object is created using the ‘new’ keyword.</p>
        <div class="code" id="interview1"><button class="copy" onclick="copyText('interview1')">Copy</button><br><p>
            ClassName obj = new ClassName();
        </p>
        </div>
        <h3>What is Object Oriented Programming?</h3>
        <p>(OOPs) is a programming model or approach where the programs are organized around objects rather than logic and functions. In other words, OOP mainly focuses on the objects that are required to be manipulated instead of logic. This approach is ideal for the programs large and complex codes and needs to be actively updated or maintained.</p>
        <h3>What are the main concepts of OOPs in Java?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Inheritance: Inheritance is a process where one class acquires the properties of another.</li>
            <li>Encapsulation: Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping up the data and code together as a single unit.</li>
            <li>Abstraction: Abstraction is the methodology of hiding the implementation details from the user and only providing the functionality to the users.</li>
            <li>Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take multiple forms.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Two Types of Polymorphism:</h2>
        <ul>
            <p>Static/Compile-Time Polymorphism:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Specifying different forms during compile time.</p>
                <p>Method Overloading</p>
            </ul>
            <p>Dynamic/Runtime Polymorphism:</p>
            <ul>
                <p>Method Overriding</p>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the difference between a local variable and an instance variable?</h3>
        <p>In Java, a local variable is typically used inside a method, constructor, or a block and has only local scope. Thus, this variable can be used only within the scope of a block. The best benefit of having a local variable is that other methods in the class won’t be even aware of that variable.</p>
        <p>instance variable in Java, is a variable which is bounded to its object itself. These variables are declared within a class, but outside a method. Every object of that class will create it’s own copy of the variable while using it. Thus, any changes made to the variable won’t reflect in any other instances of that class and will be bound to that particular instance only.</p>
        <h3>Differentiate between the constructors and methods in Java?</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Methods</th>
                <th>Constructors</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Used to represent the behavior of an object</td>
                <td>Used to initialize the state of an object</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Must have a return type</td>
                <td>Do not have any return type</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Needs to be invoked explicitly</td>
                <td>Is invoked implicitly</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No default method is provided by the compiler</td>
                <td>A default constructor is provided by the compiler if the class has none</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Method name may or may not be same as class name</td>
                <td>Constructor name must always be the same as the class name</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is final keyword in Java?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>final variable: When the final keyword is used with a variable then its value can’t be changed once assigned. In case the no value has been assigned to the final variable then using only the class constructor a value can be assigned to it.</li>
            <li>final method: When a method is declared final then it can’t be overridden by the inheriting class.</li>
            <li>final class: When a class is declared as final in Java, it can’t be extended by any subclass class but it can extend other class.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the difference between break and continue statements?</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Break</th>
                <th>Continue</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Can be used in switch and loop (for, while, do while) statements</td>
                <td>Can be only used with loop statements</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It causes the switch or loop statements to terminate the moment it is executed</td>
                <td>It doesn’t terminate the loop but causes the loop to jump to the next iteration</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It terminates the innermost enclosing loop or switch immediately</td>
                <td>A continue within a loop nested with a switch will cause the next loop iteration to execute</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is an infinite loop in Java? Explain with an example.</h3>
        <p>An infinite loop is an instruction sequence in Java that loops endlessly when a functional exit isn’t met. This type of loop can be the result of a programming error or may also be a deliberate action based on the application behavior. An infinite loop will terminate automatically once the application exits.</p>
        <p>Infinite loops can occur in loop statements where you forgot to add on to the variable that keeps track of iterations.</p>
        <p>If you have two methods that call each other, you can get a deadlock situation.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between this() and super() in Java?</h3>
        <p>In Java, super() and this(), both are special keywords that are used to call the constructor.</p>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>this()</th>
                <th>super()</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>this() represents the current instance of a class</td>
                <td>super() represents the current instance of a parent/base class</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Used to call the default constructor of the same class</td>
                <td>Used to call the default constructor of the parent/base class</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Used to access methods of the current class</td>
                <td>Used to access methods of the base class</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Used for pointing the current class instance</td>
                <td>Used for pointing the superclass instance</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Must be the first line of a block</td>
                <td>Must be the first line of a block</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is Java String Pool?</h3>
        <p>Java String pool refers to a collection of Strings which are stored in heap memory. In this, whenever a new object is created, String pool first checks whether the object is already present in the pool or not. If it is present, then the same reference is returned to the variable else new object will be created in the String pool and the respective reference will be returned.</p>
        <h3>Differentiate between static and non-static methods in Java.`</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Static Method</th>
                <th>Non-Static Method</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>he static keyword must be used before the method name</td>
                <td>No need to use the static keyword before the method name</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It is called using the class (className.methodName) </td>
                <td>It is can be called like any general method</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>They can’t access any non-static instance variables or methods</td>
                <td>It can access any static method and any static variable without creating an instance of the class</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is constructor chaining in Java?</h3>
        <p>In Java, constructor chaining is the process of calling one constructor from another with respect to the current object. Constructor chaining is possible only through legacy where a subclass constructor is responsible for invoking the superclass’ constructor first. There could be any number of classes in the constructor chain. Constructor chaining can be achieved in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Within the same class using this()</li>
            <li>From base class using super()</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What is a classloader in Java?</h3>
        <p>The Java ClassLoader is a subset of JVM (Java Virtual Machine) that is responsible for loading the class files. Whenever a Java program is executed it is first loaded by the classloader. Java provides three built-in classloaders:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Bootstrap ClassLoader</li>
            <li>Extension ClassLoader</li>
            <li>System/Application ClassLoader</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Why Java Strings are immutable in nature?</h3>
        <p>In Java, string objects are immutable in nature which simply means once the String object is created its state cannot be modified. Whenever you try to update the value of that object instead of updating the values of that particular object, Java creates a new string object. Java String objects are immutable as String objects are generally cached in the String pool. Since String literals are usually shared between multiple clients, action from one client might affect the rest. It enhances security, caching, synchronization, and performance of the application.</p>

        <h3>What is a Map in Java?</h3>
        <p>In Java, Map is an interface of Util package which maps unique keys to values. The Map interface is not a subset of the main Collection interface and thus it behaves little different from the other collection types.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Map doesn’t contain duplicate keys.</li>
            <li>Each key can map at max one value.</li>

        <h3>What is collection class in Java? List down its methods and interfaces.</h3>
        <p>In Java, the collection is a framework that acts as an architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. Using Collections you can perform various tasks like searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, deletion, etc. Java collection framework includes the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Interfaces</li>
            <li>Classes</li>
            <li>Methods</li>

        <h2>OOPS Java Interview Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is Polymorphism?</h3>
        <p>Polymorphism is briefly described as “one interface, many implementations”. Polymorphism is a characteristic of being able to assign a different meaning or usage to something in different contexts – specifically, to allow an entity such as a variable, a function, or an object to have more than one form. There are two types of polymorphism:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Compile time polymorphism: method overloading</li>
            <li>Run time polymorphism: method overriding, inheritance and interface</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch?</h3>
        <p>In Java, runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than at compile-time. In this process, an overridden method is called through the reference variable of a superclass.</p>
        <h3>What is abstraction in Java?</h3>
        <p>It basically deals with hiding the details and showing the essential things to the user. Thus you can say that abstraction in Java is the process of hiding the implementation details from the user and revealing only the functionality to them. Abstraction can be achieved in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Abstract Classes (0-100% of abstraction can be achieved)</li>
            <li>Interfaces (100% of abstraction can be achieved)</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What do you mean by an interface in Java?</h3>
        <p>An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class or you can say it is a collection of abstract methods and static constants. In an interface, each method is public and abstract but it does not contain any constructor. Thus, interface basically is a group of related methods with empty bodies.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between abstract classes and interfaces?</h3>
        <p>As of Java 8, Interfaces can have Abstract, Static and Default methods.</p>
        <p>Default methods provide a default implementation for a method in the interface and the if class that implements the interface has a method of the same name, the class definition will take precedence.</p>
        <p>With Default methods also comes the Diamond Problem (Which method do I use when both interfaces I'm implementing define one of the same name?). This is resolved by explicitly telling the program interface1.method or interface2.method.</p>
        <p>Abstract Class: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.</li>
            <li>It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.</li>
            <li>It cannot be instantiated.</li>
            <li>It can have constructors and static methods also.</li>
            <li>It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What is inheritance in Java?</h3>
        <p>Inheritance in Java is the concept where the properties of one class can be inherited by the other. It helps to reuse the code and establish a relationship between different classes. Inheritance is performed between two types of classes:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Parent class (Super or Base class)</li>
            <li>Child class (Subclass or Derived class)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A class which inherits the properties is known as Child Class whereas a class whose properties are inherited is known as Parent class.</p>
        <h3>What are the different types of inheritance in Java?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Single Inheritance: In single inheritance, one class inherits the properties of another i.e there will be only one parent as well as one child class.</li>
            <li>Multilevel Inheritance: When a class is derived from a class which is also derived from another class, i.e. a class having more than one parent class but at different levels, such type of inheritance is called Multilevel Inheritance.</li>
            <li>Hierarchical Inheritance: When a class has more than one child classes (subclasses) or in other words, more than one child classes have the same parent class, then such kind of inheritance is known as hierarchical.</li>
            <li>Hybrid Inheritance: Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is method overloading and method overriding?</h3>
        <p>Method Overloading:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Method Overloading, Methods of the same class shares the same name but each method must have a different number of parameters or parameters having different types and order.</li>
            <li>Method Overloading is to “add” or “extend” more to the method’s behavior.</li>
            <li>It is a compile-time polymorphism.</li>
            <li>The methods must have a different signature.</li>
            <li>It may or may not need inheritance in Method Overloading.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Method Overriding:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>In Method Overriding, the subclass has the same method with the same name and exactly the same number and type of parameters and same return type as a superclass.</li>
            <li>Method Overriding is to “Change” existing behavior of the method.</li>
            <li>It is a run time polymorphism.</li>
            <li>The methods must have the same signature.</li>
            <li>It always requires inheritance in Method Overriding.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Can you override a private or static method in Java?</h3>
        <p>You cannot override a private or static method in Java. If you create a similar method with the same return type and same method arguments in child class then it will hide the superclass method; this is known as method hiding. Similarly, you cannot override a private method in subclass because it’s not accessible there. What you can do is create another private method with the same name in the child class.</p>
        <h3>What is multiple inheritance? Is it supported by Java?</h3>
        <p>If a child class inherits the property from multiple classes is known as multiple inheritance. Java does not allow to extend multiple classes.</p>
        <p>The problem with multiple inheritance is that if multiple parent classes have the same method name, then at runtime it becomes difficult for the compiler to decide which method to execute from the child class. Therefore, Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance. The problem is commonly referred to as Diamond Problem.</p>
        <h3>What is encapsulation in Java?</h3>
        <p>Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind your data(variables) and code(methods) together as a single unit. Here, the data is hidden from the outer world and can be accessed only via current class methods. This helps in protecting the data from any unnecessary modification. We can achieve encapsulation in Java by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Declaring the variables of a class as private.</li>
            <li>Providing public setter and getter methods to modify and view the values of the variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is an association?</h3>
        <p>Association is a relationship where all object have their own lifecycle and there is no owner. Let’s take the example of Teacher and Student. Multiple students can associate with a single teacher and a single student can associate with multiple teachers but there is no ownership between the objects and both have their own lifecycle. These relationships can be one to one, one to many, many to one and many to many.</p>
        <h3>What do you mean by aggregation?</h3>
        <p>An aggregation is a specialized form of Association where all object has their own lifecycle but there is ownership and child object can not belong to another parent object. Let’s take an example of Department and teacher. A single teacher can not belong to multiple departments, but if we delete the department teacher object will not destroy.</p>
        <h3>What is composition in Java?</h3>
        <p>Composition is again a specialized form of Aggregation and we can call this as a “death” relationship. It is a strong type of Aggregation. Child object does not have their lifecycle and if parent object deletes all child object will also be deleted. Let’s take again an example of a relationship between House and rooms. House can contain multiple rooms there is no independent life of room and any room can not belongs to two different houses if we delete the house room will automatically delete.</p>
        <h3>What is a marker interface?</h3>
        <p>A Marker interface can be defined as the interface having no data member and member functions. In simpler terms, an empty interface is called the Marker interface. The most common examples of Marker interface in Java are Serializable, Cloneable etc. The marker interface can be declared as follows.</p>
        <h3>What is object cloning in Java?</h3>
        <p>Object cloning in Java is the process of creating an exact copy of an object. It basically means the ability to create an object with a similar state as the original object. To achieve this, Java provides a method clone() to make use of this functionality. This method creates a new instance of the class of the current object and then initializes all its fields with the exact same contents of corresponding fields. To object clone(), the marker interface java.lang.Cloneable must be implemented to avoid any runtime exceptions. One thing you must note is Object clone() is a protected method, thus you need to override it.</p>
        <h3>What is a copy constructor in Java?</h3>
        <p>Copy constructor is a member function that is used to initialize an object using another object of the same class. Though there is no need for copy constructor in Java since all objects are passed by reference. Moreover, Java does not even support automatic pass-by-value.</p>
        <h3>What is a constructor overloading in Java?</h3>
        <p>In Java, constructor overloading is a technique of adding any number of constructors to a class each having a different parameter list. The compiler uses the number of parameters and their types in the list to differentiate the overloaded constructors.</p>
        <h2>Servlets Interview Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is a servlet?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Java Servlet is server-side technologies to extend the capability of web servers by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.</li>
            <li>The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes for writing our own servlets.</li>
            <li>All servlets must implement the javax.servlet.Servlet interface, which defines servlet lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, we can extend the GenericServlet class provided with the Java Servlet API. The HttpServlet class provides methods, such as doGet() and doPost(), for handling HTTP-specific services.</li>
            <li>Most of the times, web applications are accessed using HTTP protocol and thats why we mostly extend HttpServlet class. Servlet API hierarchy is shown in below image.</li>

            <li>Cookies are text data sent by server to the client and it gets saved at the client local machine.</li>
            <li>Servlet API provides cookies support through javax.servlet.http.Cookie class that implements Serializable and Cloneable interfaces.</li>
            <li>HttpServletRequest getCookies() method is provided to get the array of Cookies from request, since there is no point of adding Cookie to request, there are no methods to set or add cookie to request.</li>
            <li>Similarly HttpServletResponse addCookie(Cookie c) method is provided to attach cookie in response header, there are no getter methods for cookie.</li>

        <h3>What are the different methods of session management in servlets?</h3>
        <p>Session is a conversational state between client and server and it can consists of multiple request and response between client and server. Since HTTP and Web Server both are stateless, the only way to maintain a session is when some unique information about the session (session id) is passed between server and client in every request and response.</p>
        <p>Some of the common ways of session management in servlets are:</p>
        <ol>

        </ul>
        <h3>What are the JDBC API components?</h3>
        <p>Interfaces:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Connection</li>
            <li>Statement</li>
            <li>PreparedStatement</li>

            <li>ResultSetMetaDatav
            <li>DatabaseMetaData</li>
            <li>CallableStatement etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Classes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>DriverManager</li>
            <li>Blob</li>
            <li>Clob</li>
            <li>Types</li>
            <li>SQLException etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the role of JDBC DriverManager class?</h3>
        <p>The DriverManager class manages the registered drivers. It can be used to register and unregister drivers. It provides factory method that returns the instance of Connection.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC Connection interface?</h3>
        <p>The Connection interface maintains a session with the database. It can be used for transaction management. It provides factory methods that returns the instance of Statement, PreparedStatement, CallableStatement and DatabaseMetaData.</p>
        <h3>What is the purpose of JDBC ResultSet interface?</h3>
        <p>The ResultSet object represents a row of a table. It can be used to change the cursor pointer and get the information from the database.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC ResultSetMetaData interface?</h3>
        <p>The ResultSetMetaData interface returns the information of table such as total number of columns, column name, column type etc.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC DatabaseMetaData interface?</h3>
        <p>The DatabaseMetaData interface returns the information of the database such as username, driver name, driver version, number of tables, number of views etc.</p>
        <h3>What do you mean by batch processing in JDBC?</h3>
        <p>Batch processing helps you to group related SQL statements into a batch and execute them instead of executing a single query. By using batch processing technique in JDBC, you can execute multiple queries which makes the performance faster.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between execute, executeQuery, executeUpdate?</h3>
        <p>Statement execute(String query) is used to execute any SQL query and it returns TRUE if the result is an ResultSet such as running Select queries. The output is FALSE when there is no ResultSet object such as running Insert or Update queries. We can use getResultSet() to get the ResultSet and getUpdateCount() method to retrieve the update count.</p>
        <p>Statement executeQuery(String query) is used to execute Select queries and returns the ResultSet. ResultSet returned is never null even if there are no records matching the query. When executing select queries we should use executeQuery method so that if someone tries to execute insert/update statement it will throw java.sql.SQLException with message “executeQuery method can not be used for update”.</p>
        <p>Statement executeUpdate(String query) is used to execute Insert/Update/Delete (DML) statements or DDL statements that returns nothing. The output is int and equals to the row count for SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. For DDL statements, the output is 0.</p>
        <p>You should use execute() method only when you are not sure about the type of statement else use executeQuery or executeUpdate method.</p>
        <h3>What do you understand by JDBC Statements?</h3>
        <p>JDBC statements are basically the statements which are used to send SQL commands to the database and retrieve data back from the database. Various methods like execute(), executeUpdate(), executeQuery, etc. are provided by JDBC to interact with the database.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Statement: Used for general purpose access to the database and executes a static SQL query at runtime.</li>
            <li>PreparedStatement: Used to provide input parameters to the query during execution.</li>
            <li>CallableStatement: Used to access the database stored procedures and helps in accepting runtime parameters.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Spring Interview Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is Spring?</h3>
        <p>Spring is essentially a lightweight, integrated framework that can be used for developing enterprise applications in java.</p>
        <h3>Name the different modules of the Spring framework.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring Context – for dependency injection.</li>
            <li>Spring AOP – for aspect oriented programming.</li>
            <li>Spring DAO – for database operations using DAO pattern</li>
            <li>Spring JDBC – for JDBC and DataSource support.</li>
            <li>Spring ORM – for ORM tools support such as Hibernate</li>
            <li>Spring Web Module – for creating web applications.</li>
            <li>Spring MVC – Model-View-Controller implementation for creating web applications, web services etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/JavaImages/Spring-Framework-Java.png" alt="Spring Framework Image" onclick="displayModal(this)"></div>
        <h3>List some of the important annotations in annotation-based Spring configuration.</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>@Required</li>
            <li>@Autowired</li>
            <li>@Qualifier</li>
            <li>@Resource</li>
            <li>@PostConstruct</li>
            <li>@PreDestroy</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Explain Bean in Spring and List the different Scopes of Spring bean.</h3>
        <p>Beans are objects that form the backbone of a Spring application. They are managed by the Spring IoC container. In other words, a bean is <b>an object that is instantiated, assembled, and managed by a Spring IoC container.</b></p>
        <p>Scopes defined in Spring beans</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Singleton: Only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans. While using this scope, make sure spring bean doesn’t have shared instance variables otherwise it might lead to data inconsistency issues because it’s not thread-safe.</li>
            <li>Prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.</li>
            <li>Request: This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.</li>
            <li>Session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.</li>
            <li>Global-session: This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Explain the role of DispatcherServlet and ContextLoaderListener.</h3>
        <p>DispatcherServlet is basically the front controller in the Spring MVC application as it loads the spring bean configuration file and initializes all the beans that have been configured. If annotations are enabled, it also scans the packages to configure any bean annotated with @Component, @Controller, @Repository or @Service annotations.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/JavaImages/Dispatcher-Servlet-768x632.png" alt="Dispatcher Servlet Image" onclick="displayModal(this)"></div>
        <p>ContextLoaderListener, on the other hand, is the listener to start up and shut down the WebApplicationContext in Spring root. Some of its important functions includes tying up the lifecycle of Application Context to the lifecycle of the ServletContext and automating the creation of ApplicationContext.</p>
        <h3>What are the differences between constructor injection and setter injection?</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Constructor Injection</th>
                <th>Setter Injection</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No Partial Injection</td>
                <td>Partial Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Doesn’t override the setter property</td>
                <td>Overrides the constructor property if both are defined.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Creates a new instance if any modification occurs</td>
                <td>Doesn’t create a new instance if you change the property value</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Better for too many properties</td>
                <td>Better for a few properties.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is autowiring in Spring? What are the autowiring modes?</h3>
        <p>Autowiring enables the programmer to inject the bean automatically. We don’t need to write explicit injection logic.</p>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>Mode</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>no</td>
                <td>this is the default mode, it means autowiring is not enabled.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ByName</td>
                <td>Injects the bean based on the property name. It uses setter method.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ByType</td>
                <td>Injects the bean based on the property type. It uses setter method.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>constructor</td>
                <td>It injects the bean using constructor</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>How to handle exceptions in Spring MVC Framework?</h3>
        <p>Controller Based: We can define exception handler methods in our controller classes. All we need is to annotate these methods with @ExceptionHandler annotation.</p>
        <p>Global Exception Handler: Exception Handling is a cross-cutting concern and Spring provides @ControllerAdvice annotation that we can use with any class to define our global exception handler.</p>
        <p>HandlerExceptionResolver implementation: For generic exceptions, most of the times we serve static pages. Spring Framework provides HandlerExceptionResolver interface that we can implement to create global exception handler. The reason behind this additional way to define global exception handler is that Spring framework also provides default implementation classes that we can define in our spring bean configuration file to get spring framework exception handling benefits.</p>
        <h3>What are some of the important Spring annotations which you have used?</h3>
        <p>@Controller – for controller classes in Spring MVC project.</p>
        <p>@RequestMapping – for configuring URI mapping in controller handler methods. This is a very important annotation, so you should go through Spring MVC RequestMapping Annotation Examples</p>
        <p>@ResponseBody – for sending Object as response, usually for sending XML or JSON data as response.</p>
        <p>@PathVariable – for mapping dynamic values from the URI to handler method arguments.</p>
        <p>@Autowired – for autowiring dependencies in spring beans.</p>
        <p>@Qualifier – with @Autowired annotation to avoid confusion when multiple instances of bean type is present.</p>
        <p>@Service – for service classes.</p>
        <p>@Scope – for configuring the scope of the spring bean.</p>
        <p>@Configuration, @ComponentScan and @Bean – for java based configurations.</p>
        <h3>How to integrate Spring and Hibernate Frameworks?</h3>
        <p>We can use Spring ORM module to integrate Spring and Hibernate frameworks if you are using Hibernate 3+ where SessionFactory provides current session, then you should avoid using HibernateTemplate or HibernateDaoSupport classes and better to use DAO pattern with dependency injection for the integration.</p>
        <p>Also, Spring ORM provides support for using Spring declarative transaction management, so you should utilize that rather than going for hibernate boiler-plate code for transaction management.</p>
        <h3>Name the types of transaction management that Spring supports.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Programmatic transaction management: In this, the transaction is managed with the help of programming. It provides you extreme flexibility, but it is very difficult to maintain.</li>
            <li>Declarative transaction management: In this, transaction management is separated from the business code. Only annotations or XML based configurations are used to manage the transactions.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Hibernate Interview Questions</h3>
        <p>Object-relational mapping or ORM is the programming technique to map application domain model objects to the relational database tables. Hibernate is Java-based ORM tool that provides a framework for mapping application domain objects to the relational database tables and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Hibernate provides a reference implementation of Java Persistence API, that makes it a great choice as ORM tool with benefits of loose coupling. We can use the Hibernate persistence API for CRUD operations. Hibernate framework provide option to map plain old java objects to traditional database tables with the use of JPA annotations as well as XML based configuration.</p>
        <h3>What are the important benefits of using Hibernate Framework?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Hibernate eliminates all the boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC and takes care of managing resources, so we can focus on business logic.</li>
            <li>Hibernate framework provides support for XML as well as JPA annotations, that makes our code implementation independent.</li>
            <li>Hibernate provides a powerful query language (HQL) that is similar to SQL. However, HQL is fully object-oriented and understands concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and association.</li>
            <li>Hibernate is an open source project from Red Hat Community and used worldwide. This makes it a better choice than others because learning curve is small and there are tons of online documentation and help is easily available in forums.</li>
            <li>Hibernate is easy to integrate with other Java EE frameworks, it’s so popular that Spring Framework provides built-in support for integrating hibernate with Spring applications.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports lazy initialization using proxy objects and perform actual database queries only when it’s required.</li>
            <li>Hibernate cache helps us in getting better performance.</li>
            <li>For database vendor specific feature, hibernate is suitable because we can also execute native sql queries.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are the differences between get and load methods?</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <th>get()</th>
                <th>load()</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Returns null if object is not found.</td>
                <td>Throws ObjectNotFoundException if an object is not found.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>get() method always hit the database.</td>
                <td>load() method hits the database only when it is required.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It returns a real object, not a proxy.</td>
                <td>It returns a proxy object.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>It should be used if you are not sure about the existence of instance.</td>
                <td>It should be used if you are sure that the instance exists.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What are the advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hibernate removes a lot of boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC API, the code looks cleaner and readable.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports inheritance, associations, and collections. These features are not present with JDBC API.</li>
            <li>Hibernate implicitly provides transaction management, in fact, most of the queries can’t be executed outside transaction. In JDBC API, we need to write code for transaction management using commit and rollback.</li>
            <li>JDBC API throws SQLException that is a checked exception, so we need to write a lot of try-catch block code. Most of the times it’s redundant in every JDBC call and used for transaction management. Hibernate wraps JDBC exceptions and throw JDBCException or HibernateException un-checked exception, so we don’t need to write code to handle it. Hibernate built-in transaction management removes the usage of try-catch blocks.</li>
            <li>Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is more object-oriented and close to Java programming language. For JDBC, we need to write native SQL queries.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports caching that is better for performance, JDBC queries are not cached hence performance is low.</li>
            <li>Hibernate provides option through which we can create database tables too, for JDBC tables must exist in the database.</li>
            <li>Hibernate configuration helps us in using JDBC like connection as well as JNDI DataSource for the connection pool. This is a very important feature in enterprise application and completely missing in JDBC API.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports JPA annotations, so the code is independent of the implementation and easily replaceable with other ORM tools. JDBC code is very tightly coupled with the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Exception and Thread Java Interview Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is the difference between Error and Exception?</h3>
        <p><b>An error is an irrecoverable condition occurring at runtime.</b> Such as OutOfMemory error. These JVM errors you cannot repair them at runtime. Though error can be caught in the catch block but the execution of application will come to a halt and is not recoverable.</p>
        <p>While <b>exceptions are conditions that occur because of bad input or human error etc.</b> e.g. FileNotFoundException will be thrown if the specified file does not exist. Or a NullPointerException will take place if you try using a null reference. In most of the cases it is possible to recover from an exception (probably by giving the user feedback for entering proper values etc.</p>
        <h3>How can you handle Java exceptions?</h3>
        <p>There are five keywords used to handle exceptions in Java:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>try</li>
            <li>catch</li>
            <li>finally</li>
            <li>throw</li>
            <li>throws</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are the differences between Checked Exception and Unchecked Exception?</h3>
        <p>Checked Exception</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions.</li>
            <li>Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.</li>
            <li>Example: IOException, SQLException etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Unchecked Exception</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions.</li>
            <li>Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time.</li>
            <li>Example: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What purpose do the keywords final, finally, and finalize fulfill? </h3>
        <p>Final is used to apply restrictions on class, method, and variable. A final class can’t be inherited, final method can’t be overridden and final variable value can’t be changed.</p>
        <p>Finally is used to place important code, it will be executed whether the exception is handled or not.</p>
        <p>Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before the object is garbage collected.</p>
        <h3>What are the differences between throw and throws?</h3>

            <tr>
                <td>Throw is used within the method.</td>

            <tr>
                <td>You cannot throw multiple exception</td>
                <td>You can declare multiple exception e.g. public void method()throws IOException,SQLException.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is exception hierarchy in java?</h3>
        <p>Throwable is a parent class of all Exception classes. There are two types of Exceptions: Checked exceptions and UncheckedExceptions or RunTimeExceptions. Both type of exceptions extends Exception class whereas errors are further classified into Virtual Machine error and Assertion error.</p>
        <h3>How to create a custom Exception?</h3>
        <p>To create you own exception extend the Exception class or any of its subclasses.</p>
        <h3>What are the important methods of Java Exception Class?</h3>
        <p>Exception and all of it’s subclasses doesn’t provide any specific methods and all of the methods are defined in the base class Throwable.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>String getMessage() – This method returns the message String of Throwable and the message can be provided while creating the exception through it’s constructor.</li>
            <li>String getLocalizedMessage() – This method is provided so that subclasses can override it to provide locale specific message to the calling program. Throwable class implementation of this method simply use getMessage() method to return the exception message.</li>
            <li>Synchronized Throwable getCause() – This method returns the cause of the exception or null id the cause is unknown.</li>
            <li>String toString() – This method returns the information about Throwable in String format, the returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized message.</li>
            <li>void printStackTrace() – This method prints the stack trace information to the standard error stream, this method is overloaded and we can pass PrintStream or PrintWriter as an argument to write the stack trace information to the file or stream.</li>

        <h3>What is a finally block? Is there a case when finally will not execute?</h3>
        <p>Finally block is a block which always executes a set of statements. It is always associated with a try block regardless of any exception that occurs or not.</p>
        <p>Yes, finally will not be executed if the program exits either by calling System.exit() or by causing a fatal error that causes the process to abort.</p>
        <h3>What is synchronization?</h3>
        <p>Synchronization refers to multi-threading. A synchronized block of code can be executed by only one thread at a time. As Java supports execution of multiple threads, two or more threads may access the same fields or objects. Synchronization is a process which keeps all concurrent threads in execution to be in sync. Synchronization avoids memory consistency errors caused due to inconsistent view of shared memory. When a method is declared as synchronized the thread holds the monitor for that method’s object. If another thread is executing the synchronized method the thread is blocked until that thread releases the monitor.</p>

        <h3>Can we write multiple catch blocks under single try block?</h3>
        <p>Yes we can have multiple catch blocks under single try block but the approach should be from specific to general.</p>
        <h3>What are the important methods of Java Exception Class?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>String getMessage() – This method returns the message String about the exception. The message can be provided through its constructor.</li>
            <li>public StackTraceElement[] getStackTrace() – This method returns an array containing each element on the stack trace. The element at index 0 represents the top of the call stack whereas the last element in the array represents the method at the bottom of the call stack.</li>
            <li>Synchronized Throwable getCause() – This method returns the cause of the exception or null id as represented by a Throwable object.</li>
            <li>String toString() – This method returns the information in String format. The returned String contains the name of Throwable class and localized message.</li>
            <li>void printStackTrace() – This method prints the stack trace information to the standard error stream.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is OutOfMemoryError in Java?</h3>
        <p>OutOfMemoryError is the subclass of java.lang.Error which generally occurs when our JVM runs out of memory.</p>
        <h3>What is a Thread?</h3>
        <p>A thread is the smallest piece of programmed instructions which can be executed independently by a scheduler. In Java, all the programs will have at least one thread which is known as the main thread. This main thread is created by the JVM when the program starts its execution. The main thread is used to invoke the main() of the program.</p>
        <h3>What are the two ways to create a thread?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By implementing the Runnable interface.</li>
            <li>By extending the Thread</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are the different types of garbage collectors in Java?</h3>
        <p>Garbage collection in Java a program which helps in implicit memory management. Since in Java, using the new keyword you can create objects dynamically, which once created will consume some memory. Once the job is done and there are no more references left to the object, Java using garbage collection destroys the object and relieves the memory occupied by it. Java provides four types of garbage collectors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Serial Garbage Collector</li>
            <li>Parallel Garbage Collector</li>
            <li>CMS Garbage Collector</li>
            <li>G1 Garbage Collector</li>
        </ul>

            <button class="collapsible">What is Java?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">List the features of Java Programming language.</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <ul>
                    <li>Simple: Java is easy to learn. The syntax of Java is based on C++ which makes easier to write the program in it.</li>
                    <li>Object-Oriented: Java follows the object-oriented paradigm which allows us to maintain our code as the combination of different type of objects that incorporates both data and behavior.</li>
                    <li>Portable: Java supports read-once-write-anywhere approach. We can execute the Java program on every machine. Java program (.java) is converted to bytecode (.class) which can be easily run on every machine.</li>
                    <li>Platform Independent: Java is a platform independent programming language. It is different from other programming languages like C and C++ which needs a platform to be executed. Java comes with its platform on which its code is executed. Java doesn't depend upon the operating system to be executed.</li>
                    <li>Secured: Java is secured because it doesn't use explicit pointers. Java also provides the concept of ByteCode and Exception handling which makes it more secured.</li>
                    <li>Robust: Java is a strong programming language as it uses strong memory management. The concepts like Automatic garbage collection, Exception handling, etc. make it more robust.</li>
                    <li>Architecture Neutral: Java is architectural neutral as it is not dependent on the architecture. In C, the size of data types may vary according to the architecture (32 bit or 64 bit) which doesn't exist in Java.</li>
                    <li>Interpreted: Java uses the Just-in-time (JIT) interpreter along with the compiler for the program execution.</li>
                    <li>High Performance: Java is faster than other traditional interpreted programming languages because Java bytecode is "close" to native code. It is still a little bit slower than a compiled language (e.g., C++).</li>
                    <li>Multithreaded: We can write Java programs that deal with many tasks at once by defining multiple threads. The main advantage of multi-threading is that it doesn't occupy memory for each thread. It shares a common memory area. Threads are important for multi-media, Web applications, etc.</li>
                    <li>Distributed: Java is distributed because it facilitates users to create distributed applications in Java. RMI and EJB are used for creating distributed applications. This feature of Java makes us able to access files by calling the methods from any machine on the internet.</li>
                    <li>Dynamic: Java is a dynamic language. It supports dynamic loading of classes. It means classes are loaded on demand. It also supports functions from its native languages, i.e., C and C++.</li>
                </ul>

            <button class="collapsible">What do you understand by Java virtual machine?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>Java Virtual Machine is a virtual machine that enables the computer to run the Java program. JVM acts like a run-time engine which calls the main method present in the Java code. JVM is the specification which must be implemented in the computer system. The Java code is compiled by JVM to be a Bytecode which is machine independent and close to the native code.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE. JVMs are available for many hardware and software platforms (so JVM is platform dependent). It is a runtime instance which is created when we run the Java class. There are three notions of the JVM: specification, implementation, and instance.</p>
                <p>JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists. It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.</p>
                <p>JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets. It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools. JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Standard Edition Java Platform</li>

                <ol>
                    <li>Class(Method) Area: Class Area stores per-class structures such as the runtime constant pool, field, method data, and the code for methods.</li>
                    <li>Heap: It is the runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects</li>
                    <li>Stack: Java Stack stores frames. It holds local variables and partial results, and plays a part in method invocation and return. Each thread has a private JVM stack, created at the same time as the thread. A new frame is created each time a method is invoked. A frame is destroyed when its method invocation completes.</li>
                    <li>Program Counter Register: PC (program counter) register contains the address of the Java virtual machine instruction currently being executed.</li>
                    <li>Native Method Stack: It contains all the native methods used in the application.</li>

            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.</p>

                <p>Classloader is a subsystem of JVM which is used to load class files. Whenever we run the java program, it is loaded first by the classloader. There are three built-in classloaders in Java.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Bootstrap ClassLoader: This is the first classloader which is the superclass of Extension classloader. It loads the rt.jar file which contains all class files of Java Standard Edition like java.lang package classes, java.net package classes, java.util package classes, java.io package classes, java.sql package classes, etc.</li>
                    <li>Extension ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Bootstrap and parent classloader of System classloader. It loads the jar files located inside $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext directory.</li>
                    <li>System/Application ClassLoader: This is the child classloader of Extension classloader. It loads the class files from the classpath. By default, the classpath is set to the current directory. You can change the classpath using "-cp" or "-classpath" switch. It is also known as Application classloader.</li>

            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>In Java, access specifiers are the keywords which are used to define the access scope of the method, class, or a variable. In Java, there are four access specifiers given below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Public The classes, methods, or variables which are defined as public, can be accessed by any class or method.</li>
                    <li>Protected Protected can be accessed by the class of the same package, or by the sub-class of this class, or within the same class.</li>
                    <li>Default Default are accessible within the package only. By default, all the classes, methods, and variables are of default scope.</li>
                    <li>Private The private class, methods, or variables defined as private can be accessed within the class only.</li>
                </ul>

            <button class="collapsible">What is the purpose of static methods and variables?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>The methods or variables defined as static are shared among all the objects of the class. The static is the part of the class and not of the object. The static variables are stored in the class area, and we do not need to create the object to access such variables. Therefore, static is used in the case, where we need to define variables or methods which are common to all the objects of the class.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What is object-oriented paradigm?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>It is a programming paradigm based on objects having data and methods defined in the class to which it belongs. Object-oriented paradigm aims to incorporate the advantages of modularity and reusability. Objects are the instances of classes which interacts with one another to design applications and programs. There are the following features of the object-oriented paradigm.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Follows the bottom-up approach in program design.</li>
                    <li>Focus on data with methods to operate upon the object's data</li>
                    <li>Includes the concept like Encapsulation and abstraction which hides the complexities from the user and show only functionality.</li>
                    <li>Implements the real-time approach like inheritance, abstraction, etc.</li>
                    <li>The examples of the object-oriented paradigm are C++, Simula, Smalltalk, Python, C#, etc.</li>

            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>The Object is the real-time entity having some state and behavior. In Java, Object is an instance of the class having the instance variables as the state of the object and the methods as the behavior of the object. The object of a class can be created by using the new keyword.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What is the constructor?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>The constructor can be defined as the special type of method that is used to initialize the state of an object. It is invoked when the class is instantiated, and the memory is allocated for the object. Every time, an object is created using the new keyword, the default constructor of the class is called. The name of the constructor must be similar to the class name. The constructor must not have an explicit return type.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">How many types of constructors are used in Java?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>Default Constructor: default constructor is the one which does not accept any value. The default constructor is mainly used to initialize the instance variable with the default values. It can also be used for performing some useful task on object creation. A default constructor is invoked implicitly by the compiler if there is no constructor defined in the class.</p>
                <p>Parameterized Constructor: The parameterized constructor is the one which can initialize the instance variables with the given values. In other words, we can say that the constructors which can accept the arguments are called parameterized constructors.</p>

                <p>There is a compiler error in the program because there is a call to the default constructor in the main method which is not present in the class. However, there is only one parameterized constructor in the class Test. Therefore, no default constructor is invoked by the constructor implicitly.</p>

            <button class="collapsible">What is the static variable?</button>
            <div class="innerContent">
                <p>The static variable is used to refer to the common property of all objects (that is not unique for each object), e.g., The company name of employees, college name of students, etc. Static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading. Using a static variable makes your program more memory efficient (it saves memory). Static variable belongs to the class rather than the object.</p>

        <h2>Constructor Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is a Constructor?</h3>
        <p>Constructors are used to initialize the object’s state. Like methods, a constructor also contains collection of statements(i.e. instructions) that are executed at time of Object creation.</p>
        <h3>Do we have Copy Constructor in Java?</h3>
        <p>Java doesn't create a default copy constructor if you don't write your own.</p>
        <h3>What is Constructor Chaining</h3>
        <p>Constructor Chaining is a technique of calling another constructor from one constructor. this() is used to call same class constructor where as super() is used to call super class constructor.</p>
        <h3>Can we call sub class constructor from super class constructor?</h3>
        <p>No. There is no way in java to call sub class constructor from a super class constructor.</p>
        <h3>What happens if you keep a return type for a constructor?</h3>
        <p>Ideally, Constructor must not have a return type. By definition, if a method has a return type, it’s not a constructor. It will be treated as a normal method. But compiler gives a warning saying that method has a constructor name.</p>
        <h3>What is No-arg constructor?</h3>
        <p>Constructor without arguments is called no-arg constructor. Default constructor in java is always a no-arg constructor.</p>
        <h3>How a no – argument constructor is different from default Constructor?</h3>
        <p>If a class contains no constructor declarations, then a default constructor with no formal parameters and no throws clause is implicitly declared. If the class being declared is the primordial class Object, then the default constructor has an empty body. Otherwise, the default constructor simply invokes the superclass constructor with no arguments.</p>
        <h3>What are private constructors and where are they used?</h3>
        <p>Like any method we can provide access specifier to the constructor. If it’s made private, then it can only be accessed inside the class.</p>
        <p>The major scenarios where we use private constructor:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Internal Constructor chaining</li>
            <li>Singleton class design pattern</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>When do we need Constructor Overloading?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes there is a need of initializing an object in different ways. This can be done using constructor overloading. Different constructors can do different work by implementing different line of codes and are called based on the type and number of parameters passed.</p>
        <h3>Do we have destructors in Java?</h3>
        <p>No, Because Java is a garbage collected language you cannot predict when (or even if) an object will be destroyed. Hence there is no direct equivalent of a destructor.</p>
    </div>
    &nbsp;
    <button class="collapsible">Lambda Expressions</button>
    <div class="innerContent">
        <h2>Lambda Expression Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is a lambda expression?</h3>
        <p>Lambda expression in itself is an anonymous method i.e. a method with no name which is used to provide implementation of the method defined by a functional interface.</p>
        <h3>What is a functional interface?</h3>
        <p>A functional interface is an interface with only one abstract method.</p>
        <h3>How do you use lambda expression with functional interfaces?</h3>
        <p>Lambda expression provides implementation of the abstract method defined by the functional interface.</p>
        <h3>What is block lambda expression?</h3>
        <p>A block lambda is the lambda expression where the right side of the lambda expression is a block of code.</p>
        <h3>Can we have a generic functional interface?</h3>
        <p>Since lambda expression doesn't have type parameters of its own so it can't be generic. But the functional interface that specifies the target type for the lambda expression can be generic.</p>
        <h3>What is functional interface annotation?</h3>
        <p>Java 8 also introduces an annotation @FunctionalInterface to be used with functional interface.</p>
        <h3>Is it mandatory to mark functional interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation?</h3>
        <p>It is not mandatory to mark functional interface with @FunctionalInterface annotation, it is more of a best practice to do that and also gives a surety that no other abstract method will be added accidentally to the functional interface.</p>
        <h3>What is effective final in Java? What is variable capture?</h3>
        <p>A lambda expression may only use local variable whose value doesn't change. That restriction is referred as "variable capture".</p>
        <p>The local variables that a lambda expression may use are known as "effectively final". An effectively final variable is one whose value does not change after it is first assigned.</p>
        <h3>Can lambda expression throw exception? Is there any restriction in lambda expression exception handling?</h3>
        <p>A lambda expression can throw an exception but lambda expression must throw exception compatible with those specified in the throws clause of the functional interface method.</p>
        <h3>What is method reference in Java 8?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lambda expressions can be used to call an existing method.</li>
            <li>General form of Method reference - ClassName (or object)::methodName</li>
            <li>Class name or instance is separated from the method name by a double colon.</li>
        </ul>

    <button class="collapsible">Servlets</button>
    <div class="innerContent">
        <h2>Servlet Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is a servlet?</h3>
        <p>Java Servlet is server side technologies to extend the capability of web servers by providing support for dynamic response and data persistence.</p>
        <p>The javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages provide interfaces and classes for writing our own servlets.</p>
        <h3>Can you explain the Servlet Container?</h3>
        <p>It provides the runtime environment for JavaEE (j2ee) applications. The client/user can request only static WebPages from the server. If the user wants to read the web pages as per input then the servlet container is used in java.</p>
        <h3>What are the common tasks performed by Servlet Container?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Communication Support: Servlet Container provides easy way of communication between web client (Browsers) and the servlets and JSPs.</li>
            <li>Lifecycle and Resource Management: Servlet Container takes care of managing the life cycle of servlet. From the loading of servlets into memory, initializing servlets, invoking servlet methods and to destroy them.</li>
            <li>Multi-threading Support: Container creates new thread for every request to the servlet and provide them request and response objects to process. So servlets are not initialized for each request and saves time and memory.</li>
            <li>JSP Support: JSPs do not look like normal java classes but every JSP in the application is compiled by container and converted to Servlet and then container manages them like other servlets.</li>
            <li>Miscellaneous Task: Servlet container manages the resource pool, perform memory optimizations, execute garbage collector, provides security configurations, support for multiple applications, hot deployment and several other tasks behind the scene that makes a developer life easier.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the ServletConfig object?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ServletConfig is used to pass configuration information to a single Servlet.</li>
            <li>The Servlet container is responsible for instantiating this object.</li>
            <li>Every servlet has its own ServletConfig object.</li>
            <li>We can provide servlet init parameters in the web.xml file or through the use of annotation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is ServletContext object?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ServletContext object provide access to web application parameters to the servlets.</li>
            <li>This object is available to all the servlets in the web application.</li>
            <li>When we want some init parameters to be available to multiple or all of the servlets in the web application, we can use ServletContext object and define parameters in web.xml using the &lt;context-param&gt; element.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>ServletConfig vs ServletContext</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ServletConfig is a unique object per servlet whereas ServletContext is a unique object for complete application.</li>
            <li>ServletConfig is used to provide init parameters to the servlet whereas ServletContext is used to provide application level init parameters that all other servlets can use.</li>
            <li>We can’t set attributes in ServletConfig object whereas we can set attributes in ServletContext that other servlets can use in their implementation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the Request Dispatcher?</h3>
        <p>An interface used to forward the request to another resource that can be HTML, JSP or another servlet in the same application. It is used for inter-servlet communication.</p>
        <p>There are two methods defined in this interface:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>void forward(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Forwards the request from a servelt to another resource on the server.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>void include (ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Includes the content of a resource in the response.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>How do we call one servlet from another servlet?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>We can use RequestDispatcher forward() method to forward the processing of a request to another servlet.</li>
            <li>We can use RequestDispatcher include() method to include another servlets output to the response.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How can we create deadlock situation in servlet?</h3>
        <p>We can create deadlock in servlet by making a loop of method invocation, just call doPost() method from doGet() method and doGet() method to doPost() method to create deadlock situation in servlet.</p>
        <h3>Do we need to override service() method?</h3>
        <p>When servlet container receives client request, it invokes the service() method which in turn invokes the doGet(), doPost() methods based on the HTTP method of request. The whole purpose of service() method is to forward to request to corresponding HTTP method implementations. So, there would be no reason to overrid the service() method.</p>
        <h3>What are the phases of servlet life cycle?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Servlet Class Loading – When container receives request for a servlet, it first loads the class into memory and calls it’s default no-args constructor.</li>
            <li>Servlet Class Initialization - The container then initializes the ServletContext object for the servlet and invokes it’s init method by passing servlet config object.</li>
            <li>Request Handling - For every client request, servlet container spawns a new thread and invokes the service() method by passing the request and response object reference.</li>
            <li>Removal from Service - When container stops or we stop the application, servlet container destroys the servlet class by invoking it’s destroy() method.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are life cycle methods of a servlet?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>public void init(ServletConfig config)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Used by the container to initialize the servlet, this method is invoked only once in the lifecycle of servlet.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>public void service(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This method is called once for every request, container can’t invoke service() method unless init() method is executed.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>public void destroy()</li>
            <ul>
                <li>This method is invoked once when servlet is unloaded from memory.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are different methods of session management in servlets?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML Hidden Fields</li>
            <li>URL Rewriting: When using HttpSession and cookies are dissabled, Then URL rewriting is used. It involes encoding the URL to pass information to another resource.</li>
            <li>HttpSession</li>
            <li>Cookies: Text data sent by the server to the client and it gets saved at the client local machine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>JDBC Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is JDBC API and when do we use it?</h3>
        <p>Java DataBase Connectivity API allows us to work with relational databases. JDBC API interfaces and classes are part of java.sql and javax.sql package. We can use JDBC API to get the database connection, run SQL queries and stored procedures in the database server and process the results.</p>
        <h3>What are different types of JDBC Drivers?</h3>
        <p>There are four types of JDBC drivers.</p>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <td>JDBC-ODBC Bridge plus ODBC Driver (Type 1)</td>
                <td>Uses ODBC driver to connect to database. We should have ODBC drivers installed to connect to database, that’s why this driver is almost obsolete.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Native API partly Java technology-enabled driver (Type 2)</td>
                <td>Converts JDBC class to the client API for the database servers. We should have database client API installed. Because of extra dependency on database client API drivers, this is also not preferred driver.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pure Java Driver for Database Middleware (Type 3)</td>
                <td>Sends the JDBC calls to a middleware server that can connect to different types of databases. We should have a middleware server installed to work with this driver. This adds to extra network calls and slow performance and that's why it's not widely used JDBC driver.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Direct-to-Database Pure Java Driver (Type 4)</td>
                <td>Converts the JDBC calls to the network protocol understood by the database server. This solution is simple and suitable for database connectivity over the network. However for this solution, we should use database specific drivers, for example OJDBC jars by Oracle for Oracle DB and MySQL Connector/J for MySQL databases.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>How does JDBC API help us achieve a loose coupling between Java Program and JDBC Drivers API?</h3>
        <p>JDBC API uses Java Reflection API to achieve loose coupling between java programs and JDBC Drivers. All the programming is done in terms of JDBC API and Driver comes in picture only when it’s loaded through reflection using Class.forName() method.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC Connection? Explain the steps to get a Database connection.</h3>
        <p>JDBC Connection is like a Session created with the database server.</p>
        <p>Creating a JDBC Connection is very easy and requires two steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Register and Load the Driver: Using Class.forName(), Driver class is registered to the DriverManager and loaded in the memory.</li>
            <li>Use DriverManager to get the Connection object: We get connection object from DriverManager.getConnection() by passing Database URL String, username and password as arguments.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is the use of JDBC DriverManager class?</h3>
        <p>JDBC DriverManager is the factory class through which we get the Database Connection object.</p>
        <p>When we load the JDBC Driver class, it registers itself to the DriverManager.</p>
        <p>Then when we call DriverManager.getConnection() method by passing the database configuration details, DriverManager uses the registered drivers to get the Connection and return it to the caller program.</p>
        <h3>How do you get the Database server details in a java program?</h3>
        <p>We can use DatabaseMetaData object to get the database server details. When the database connection is created successfully, we can get the meta data object by calling getMetaData() method.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC Statement?</h3>
        <p>JDBC API Statement is used to execute SQL queries in the database. We can create the Statement object by calling Connection createStatement() method. We can use Statement to execute static SQL queries by passing query through different execute methods such as execute(), executeQuery(), executeUpdate() etc.</p>
        <p>Since the query is generated in the java program, if the user input is not properly validated it can lead to an SQL injection.</p>
        <h3>What is the difference between execute, executeQuery and executeUpdate?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Statement execute(String query) is used to execute any SQL query and it returns TRUE if the result is an ResultSet such as running Select queries.</li>
            <p>We can use getResultSet() to get the ResultSet and getUpdateCount() method to retrieve the update count.</p>
            <li>Statement executeQuery(String query) is used to execute Select queries and returns the ResultSet.</li>
            <li>Statement executeUpdate(String query) is used to execute Insert/Update/Delete (DML) statements or DDL statements that returns nothing. The output is int and equals the row count for SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements. For DDL statements, the output is 0.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is JDBC PreparedStatement?</h3>
        <p>JDBC PreparedStatement object represents a precompiled SQL statement.</p>
        <p>Since PreparedStatement is precompiled, it can then be used to efficiently execute this statement multiple times. PreparedStatement is better choice that Statement because it automatically escapes the special characters and avoid SQL injection attacks.</p>
        <h3>How to set NULL values in JDBC PreparedStatement?</h3>
        <p>We can use PreparedStatement setNull() method to bind the null variable to a parameter. The setNull method takes index and SQL Types as argument, for example: ps.setNull(10, java.sql.Types.INTEGER);</p>
        <h3>What are the benefits of PreparedStatement over Statement?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>PreparedStatement helps us in preventing SQL injection attacks because it automatically escapes the special characters.</li>
            <li>PreparedStatement allows us to execute dynamic queries with parameter inputs.</li>
            <li>PreparedStatement is faster than Statement. It becomes more visible when we reuse the PreparedStatement or use it’s batch processing methods for executing multiple queries.</li>
            <li>PreparedStatement helps us in writing object Oriented code with setter methods whereas with Statement we have to use String Concatenation to create the query. If there are multiple parameters to set, writing Query using String concatenation looks very ugly and error prone.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the limitation of PreparedStatement and how to overcome it?</h3>
        <p>One of the limitation of PreparedStatement is that we can’t use it directly with IN clause statements.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Execute Single Queries – very slow performance and not recommended</li>
            <li>Using Stored Procedure – Database specific and hence not suitable for multiple database applications.</li>
            <li>Creating PreparedStatement Query dynamically – Good approach but looses the benefit of cached PreparedStatement.</li>
            <li>Using NULL in PreparedStatement Query – A good approach when you know the maximum number of variables inputs, can be extended to allow unlimited parameters by executing in parts.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is JDBC ResultSet?</h3>
        <p>JDBC ResultSet is like a table of data representing a database result set, which is usually generated by executing a statement that queries the database.</p>
        <p>ResultSet object maintains a cursor pointing to its current row of data. Initially, the cursor is positioned before the first row. The next() method moves the cursor to the next row.</p>
        <p>A default ResultSet object is not updatable and has a cursor that moves forward only. Thus, you can iterate through it only once and only from the first row to the last row.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC RowSet? What are different types of RowSet?</h3>
        <p>JDBC RowSet holds tabular data in more flexible ways than ResultSet.</p>
        <p>All RowSet objects are derived from ResultSet, so they have all the capabilities of ResultSet with some additional features.</p>
        <p>RowSet is divided into two types:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Connected RowSet Objects – These objects are connected to database and are most similar to ResultSet object. JDBC API provides only one connected RowSet object javax.sql.rowset.JdbcRowSet and it’s standard implementation class is com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl</li>
            <li>Disconnected RowSet Objects – These RowSet objects are not required to connected to a database, so they are more lightweight and serializable. They are suitable for sending data over a network. There are four types of disconnected RowSet implementations.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>CachedRowSet – They can get the connection and execute a query and read the ResultSet data to populate the RowSet data. We can manipulate and update data while it is disconnected and reconnect to database and write the changes.</li>
                <li>WebRowSet derived from CachedRowSet – They can read and write XML document.</li>
                <li>JoinRowSet derived from WebRowSet – They can form SQL JOIN without having to connect to a data source.</li>
                <li>FilteredRowSet derived from WebRowSet – We can apply filtering criteria so that only selected data is visible.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are different types of ResultSet?</h3>
        <p>There are three types of ResultSet object.</p>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <td>ResultSet.TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY</td>
                <td>This is the default type and cursor can only move forward in the result set.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE</td>
                <td>The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is not sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_SENSITIVE</td>
                <td>The cursor can move forward and backward, and the result set is sensitive to changes made by others to the database after the result set was created.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <p>Based on the concurrency there are two types of ResultSet object.</p>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <td>ResultSet.CONCUR_READ_ONLY</td>
                <td>The result set is read only, this is the default concurrency type.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE</td>
                <td>We can use ResultSet update method to update the rows data.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What is the difference between ResultSet and RowSet?</h3>
        <p>RowSet objects are derived from ResultSet, so they have all the features of ResultSet with some additional features. One of the huge benefit of RowSet is that they can be disconnected and that makes it lightweight and easy to transfer over a network.</p>
        <p>Whether to use ResultSet or RowSet depends on your requirements but if you are planning to use ResultSet for longer duration, then a disconnected RowSet is better choice to free database resources.</p>
        <h3>How do we use JDBC API to call Stored Procedures?</h3>
        <p>Stored Procedures are a group of SQL queries that are compiled in the database and can be executed from JDBC API. JDBC CallableStatement can be used to execute stored procedures in the database.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC Batch Processing and what are it’s benefits?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes we need to run bulk queries of a similar kind for a database.</p>
        <p>JDBC API supports batch processing through Statement and PreparedStatement addBatch() and executeBatch() methods.</p>
        <p>Batch Processing is faster than executing one statement at a time because the number of database calls is less.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC Transaction Management and why do we need it?</h3>
        <p>By default when we create a database connection, it runs in auto-commit mode. It means that whenever we execute a query and it’s completed, the commit is fired automatically. So every SQL query we fire is a transaction and if we are running some DML or DDL queries, the changes are getting saved into the database after every SQL statement finishes.</p>
        <p>JDBC API provides the method setAutoCommit(boolean flag) through which we can disable the auto commit feature of the connection.</p>
        <h3>How to rollback a JDBC transaction?</h3>
        <p>We can use Connection object rollback() method to rollback the transaction. It will rollback all the changes made by the transaction and release any database locks currently held by this Connection object.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC Savepoint? How to use it?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes a transaction can be a group of multiple statements and we would like to rollback to a particular point in the transaction. JDBC Savepoint helps us in creating checkpoints in a transaction and we can rollback to that particular checkpoint.</p>
        <h3>What is JDBC DataSource and what are its benefits?</h3>
        <p>JDBC DataSource is the interface defined in javax.sql package and it is more powerful than DriverManager for database connections.</p>
        <p>DataSource provides some additional features such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Caching of PreparedStatement for faster processing</li>
            <li>Connection timeout settings</li>
            <li>Logging features</li>
            <li>ResultSet maximum size threshold</li>
            <li>Connection Pooling in servlet container using JNDI support</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is JDBC Connection isolation levels?</h3>
        <p>When we use JDBC Transactions for data integrity, DBMS uses locks to block access by others to the data being accessed by the transaction. DBMS uses locks to prevent Dirty Read, Non-Repeatable Reads and Phantom-Read issues.</p>
        <p>Isolation Levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>TRANSACTION_NONE</li>
            <li>TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED</li>
            <li>TRANSACTION_READ_UNCOMMITTED</li>
            <li>TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ</li>
            <li>TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are common JDBC Exceptions?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>java.sql.SQLException – This is the base exception class for JDBC exceptions.</li>
            <li>java.sql.BatchUpdateException – This exception is thrown when Batch operation fails, but it depends on the JDBC driver whether they throw this exception or the base SQLException.</li>
            <li>java.sql.SQLWarning – For warning messages in SQL operations.</li>
            <li>java.sql.DataTruncation – when a data values is unexpectedly truncated for reasons other than its having exceeded MaxFieldSize.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is “dirty read” in JDBC? Which isolation level prevents dirty read?</h3>
        <p>When we work with transactions, there is a chance that a row is updated and at the same time, another query can read the updated value. This results in a dirty read because the updated value is not permanent yet, the transaction that has updated the row can rollback to a previous value resulting in invalid data.</p>
        <p>Dirty Read is prevented by these isolation levels: TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED, TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ, and TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE.</p>
        <h3>What is 2 phase commit?</h3>
        <p>In the first phase, the transaction manager sends commit-request to all the transaction resources. If all the transaction resources are OK, the transaction manager commits the transaction changes for all the resources. If any of the transaction resources responds as Abort, then the transaction manager can rollback all the transaction changes.</p>
        <h3>What is phantom read and which isolation level prevents it?</h3>
        <p>A phantom read is the situation where a transaction executes a query multiple times and gets different data.</p>
        <p>Suppose a transaction is executing a query to get data based on a condition and then another transaction inserts a row that matches the condition. Now when same transaction will execute the query again, a new row will be part of the result set. This new row is referred as Phantom Row and this situation is termed as Phantom Read.</p>
        <p>Phantom read can be prevented only with TRANSACTION_SERIALIZABLE isolation level.</p>
        <h3>What is SQL Warning? How to retrieve SQL warnings in the JDBC program?</h3>
        <p>SQLWarning is the subclass of SQLException and we can retrieve it by calling getWarnings() method on Connection, Statement, and ResultSet objects.</p>
        <p>SQL Warnings doesn’t stop the execution of the script but alerts the user about the warning.</p>
        <h3>When do we get java.sql.SQLException: No suitable driver found?</h3>
        <p>You get No suitable driver found exception when the SQL URL String is not properly formatted. You can get this exception in both simple java application using DriverManager or with JNDI resource using DataSource.</p>
        <h3>What are JDBC Best Practices?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Database resources are heavy, so make sure you close it as soon as you are done with it. Connection, Statement, ResultSet and all other JDBC objects have close() method defined to close them.</li>
            <li>Always close the result set, statement and connection explicitly in the code, because if you are working in connection pooling environment, the connection might be returned to the pool leaving open result sets and statement objects resulting in resource leak.</li>
            <li>Close the resources in the finally block to make sure they are closed even in case of exception scenarios.</li>
            <li>Use batch processing for bulk operations of similar kind.</li>
            <li>Always use PreparedStatement over Statement to avoid SQL Injection and get pre-compilation and caching benefits of PreparedStatement.</li>
            <li>If you are retrieving bulk data into result set, setting an optimal value for fetchSize helps in getting good performance.</li>
            <li>The database server might not support all isolation levels, so check it before assuming.</li>
            <li>More strict isolation levels result in slow performance, so make sure you have optimal isolation level set for your database connections.</li>
            <li>If you are creating database connections in a web application, try to use JDBC DataSource resources using JNDI context for re-using the connections.</li>
            <li>Try to use disconnected RowSet when you need to work with ResultSet for a long time.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="innerContent">
        <h2>Hibernate Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is the ORM Framework?</h3>
        <p>Object-relational mapping or ORM is the programming technique to map application domain model objects to the relational database tables.</p>
        <h3>What is the Hibernate Framework?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate is java based ORM tool that provides framework for mapping application domain objects to the relational database tables and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Hibernate framework provide option to map plain old java objects to traditional database tables with the use of JPA annotations as well as XML based configuration.</p>
        <h3>What are the core components of Hibernate?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Configuration</li>
            <li>SessionFactory</li>
            <li>Session</li>
            <li>Query</li>
            <li>Criteria</li>
            <li>Transaction</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is Java Persistence API (JPA)?</h3>
        <p>Java Persistence API (JPA) provides specification for managing the relational data in applications.</p>
        <p>JPA specifications is defined with annotations in javax.persistence package. Using JPA annotation helps us in writing implementation independent code.</p>
        <h3>What are the important benefits of using Hibernate Framework?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Hibernate eliminates all the boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC and takes care of managing resources, so we can focus on business logic.</li>
            <li>Hibernate framework provides support for XML as well as JPA annotations, that makes our code implementation independent.</li>
            <li>Hibernate provides a powerful query language (HQL) that is similar to SQL. However, HQL is fully object-oriented and understands concepts like inheritance, polymorphism and association.</li>
            <li>Hibernate is an open source project from Red Hat Community and used worldwide. This makes it a better choice than others because learning curve is small and there are tons of online documentations and help is easily available in forums.</li>
            <li>Hibernate is easy to integrate with other Java EE frameworks, it’s so popular that Spring Framework provides built-in support for integrating hibernate with Spring applications.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports lazy initialization using proxy objects and perform actual database queries only when it’s required.</li>
            <li>Hibernate cache helps us in getting better performance.</li>
            <li>For database vendor specific feature, hibernate is suitable because we can also execute native sql queries.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are the advantages of Hibernate over JDBC?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Hibernate removes a lot of boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC API, the code looks more cleaner and readable.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports inheritance, associations and collections. These features are not present with JDBC API.</li>
            <li>Hibernate implicitly provides transaction management, in fact most of the queries can’t be executed outside transaction. In JDBC API, we need to write code for transaction management using commit and rollback. Read more at JDBC Transaction Management.</li>
            <li>JDBC API throws SQLException that is a checked exception, so we need to write a lot of try-catch block code. Most of the times it’s redundant in every JDBC call and used for transaction management. Hibernate wraps JDBC exceptions and throw JDBCException or HibernateException un-checked exception, so we don’t need to write code to handle it. Hibernate built-in transaction management removes the usage of try-catch blocks.</li>
            <li>Hibernate Query Language (HQL) is more object oriented and close to java programming language. For JDBC, we need to write native sql queries.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports caching that is better for performance, JDBC queries are not cached hence performance is low.</li>
            <li>Hibernate provide option through which we can create database tables too, for JDBC tables must exist in the database.</li>
            <li>Hibernate configuration helps us in using JDBC like connection as well as JNDI DataSource for connection pool. This is very important feature in enterprise application and completely missing in JDBC API.</li>
            <li>Hibernate supports JPA annotations, so code is independent of implementation and easily replaceable with other ORM tools. JDBC code is very tightly coupled with the application.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Name some important interfaces of Hibernate framework?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>SessionFactory (org.hibernate.SessionFactory): SessionFactory is an immutable thread-safe cache of compiled mappings for a single database. We need to initialize SessionFactory once and then we can cache and reuse it. SessionFactory instance is used to get the Session objects for database operations.</li>
            <li>Session (org.hibernate.Session): Session is a single-threaded, short-lived object representing a conversation between the application and the persistent store. It wraps JDBC java.sql.Connection and works as a factory for org.hibernate.Transaction. We should open session only when it’s required and close it as soon as we are done using it. Session object is the interface between java application code and hibernate framework and provide methods for CRUD operations.</li>
            <li>Transaction (org.hibernate.Transaction): Transaction is a single-threaded, short-lived object used by the application to specify atomic units of work. It abstracts the application from the underlying JDBC or JTA transaction. A org.hibernate.Session might span multiple org.hibernate.Transaction in some cases.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is Hibernate SessionFactory and how to configure it?</h3>
        <p>SessionFactory is the factory class used to get the Session objects. SessionFactory is responsible for reading the hibernate configuration parameters and connect to the database and provide Session objects.</p>
        <p>The internal state of a SessionFactory is immutable. Once it is created this internal state is set. This internal state includes all of the metadata about Object/Relational Mapping.</p>
        <p>SessionFactory also provide methods to get the Class metadata and Statistics instance to get the stats of query executions, second level cache details etc.</p>
        <h3>What is a hibernate configuration file?</h3>
        <p>A Hibernate configuration file contains database specific configurations and is used to initialize SessionFactory. We provide database credentials or JNDI resource information in the hibernate configuration xml file. Some other important parts of hibernate configuration file is Dialect information, so that hibernate knows the database type and mapping file or class details.</p>
        <h3>What is hibernate mapping file?</h3>
        <p>A Hibernate mapping file is used to define the entity bean fields and database table column mappings. We know that JPA annotations can be used for mapping but sometimes XML mapping file comes in handy when we are using third party classes and we can’t use annotations.</p>
        <h3>Name some important annotations used for Hibernate mapping?</h3>

            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>Is Hibernate SessionFactory thread safe?</h3>
        <p>Internal state of SessionFactory is immutable, so it’s thread safe.</p>
        <h3>What is Hibernate Session and how to get it?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate Session is the interface between java application layer and hibernate. This is the core interface used to perform database operations. Lifecycle of a session is bound by the beginning and end of a transaction.</p>
        <p>Session provides methods to perform create, read, update and delete operations for a persistent object. We can execute HQL queries, SQL native queries and create criteria using Session object.</p>
        <h3>Is Hibernate Session thread safe?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate Session object is not thread safe, every thread should get it’s own session instance and close it after it’s work is finished.</p>
        <h3>What is difference between openSession and getCurrentSession?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate SessionFactory getCurrentSession() method returns the session bound to the context. But for this to work, we need to configure it in hibernate configuration file.</p>
        <p>Hibernate SessionFactory openSession() method always opens a new session. We should close this session object once we are done with all the database operations. We should open a new session for each request in multi-threaded environment.</p>
        <h3>What is boilerplate code (boilerplate)</h3>
        <p>boilerplate are sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration.</p>
        <p>The programmer must write a lot of code to accomplish only minor functionality.</p>
        <h3>What is difference between Hibernate Session get() and load() method?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>get() loads the data as soon as it’s called whereas load() returns a proxy object and loads data only when it’s actually required, so load() is better because it support lazy loading.</li>
            <li>Since load() throws exception when data is not found, we should use it only when we know data exists.</li>
            <li>We should use get() when we want to make sure data exists in the database.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is hibernate caching? Explain Hibernate first level cache?</h3>
        <p>As the name suggests, hibernate caches query data to make our application faster. Hibernate Cache can be very useful in gaining fast application performance if used correctly. The idea behind cache is to reduce the number of database queries, hence reducing the throughput time of the application.</p>
        <h3>What are different states of an entity bean?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Transient: When an object is never persisted or associated with any session, it’s in transient state. Transient instances may be made persistent by calling save(), persist() or saveOrUpdate(). Persistent instances may be made transient by calling delete().</li>
            <li>Persistent: When an object is associated with a unique session, it’s in persistent state. Any instance returned by a get() or load() method is persistent.</li>
            <li>Detached: When an object is previously persistent but not associated with any session, it’s in detached state. Detached instances may be made persistent by calling update(), saveOrUpdate(), lock() or replicate(). The state of a transient or detached instance may also be made persistent as a new persistent instance by calling merge().</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is use of Hibernate Session merge() call?</h3>
        <p>merge can be used to get a fresh copy of an entity, discarding changes made while in a detached state and returning an object in a persistent state.</p>
        <h3>What is difference between Hibernate save(), saveOrUpdate() and persist() methods?</h3>
        <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
            <tr>
                <td>save()</td>
                <td>Hibernate save can be used to save entity to database. Problem with save() is that it can be invoked without a transaction and if we have mapping entities, then only the primary object gets saved causing data inconsistencies. Also save returns the generated id immediately.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>persist()</td>
                <td>Hibernate persist is similar to save, but with a transaction. We can’t use it outside the boundary of transaction, so all the object mappings are preserved. Also persist doesn’t return the generated id immediately, so data persistence happens when needed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>saveOrUpdate()</td>
                <td>Hibernate saveOrUpdate results in insert or update queries based on the provided data. If the data is present in the database, update query is executed. We can use saveOrUpdate() without transaction also, but again you will face the issues with mapped objects not getting saved if session is not flushed.</td>
            </tr>
        </table></div>
        <h3>What will happen if we don’t have a no-args constructor in Entity bean?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate uses Reflection API to create instance of Entity beans, usually when you call get() or load() methods. The method Class.newInstance() is used for this and it requires no-args constructor. So if you won’t have no-args constructor in entity beans, hibernate will fail to instantiate it and you will get HibernateException.</p>
        <h3>What are the collection types in Hibernate?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bag</li>
            <li>Set</li>
            <li>List</li>
            <li>Array</li>
            <li>Map</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>How to implement Joins in Hibernate?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Using associations such as one-to-one, one-to-many etc.</li>
            <li>Using JOIN in the HQL query. There is another form “join fetch” to load associated data simultaneously, no lazy loading.</li>
            <li>We can fire native sql query and use join keyword.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Why we should not make Entity Class final?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate use proxy classes for lazy loading of data, only when it’s needed. This is done by extending the entity bean, if the entity bean will be final then lazy loading will not be possible, hence low performance.</p>
        <h3>What is HQL and what are it’s benefits?</h3>
        <p>HQL: Hibernate Query Language, is a better choice than SQL queries because we use Objects instead of table names, which makes it closer to object oriented programming.</p>
        <p>Hibernate query language is case-insensitive except for java class and variable names.</p>
        <h3>Can we execute native sql query in hibernate?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate provide option to execute native SQL queries through the use of SQLQuery object.</p>
        <h3>What is the benefit of native sql query support in hibernate?</h3>
        <p>Native SQL Query comes handy when we want to execute database specific queries that are not supported by Hibernate API such as query hints or the CONNECT keyword in Oracle Database.</p>
        <h3>What is Named SQL Query?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate provides Named Query that we can define at a central location and use them anywhere in the code. We can created named queries for both HQL and Native SQL.</p>
        <p>Hibernate Named Queries can be defined in Hibernate mapping files or through the use of JPA annotations @NamedQuery and @NamedNativeQuery.</p>
        <h3>What are the benefits of Named SQL Query?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Hibernate Named Query helps us in grouping queries at a central location rather than letting them scattered all over the code.</li>
            <li>Hibernate Named Query syntax is checked when the hibernate session factory is created, thus making the application fail fast in case of any error in the named queries.</li>
            <li>Hibernate Named Query is global, means once defined it can be used throughout the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However one of the major disadvantage of Named query is that it’s hard to debug, because we need to find out the location where it’s defined.</p>
        <h3>What is the benefit of Hibernate Criteria API?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate provides Criteria API that is more object oriented for querying the database and getting results. We can’t use Criteria to run update or delete queries or any DDL statements. It’s only used to fetch the results from the database using more object oriented approach.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Criteria API provides Projection that we can use for aggregate functions such as sum(), min(), max() etc.</li>
            <li>Criteria API can be used with ProjectionList to fetch selected columns only.</li>
            <li>Criteria API can be used for join queries by joining multiple tables, useful methods are createAlias(), setFetchMode() and setProjection()</li>
            <li>Criteria API can be used for fetching results with conditions, useful methods are add() where we can add Restrictions.</li>
            <li>Criteria API provides addOrder() method that we can use for ordering the results.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is Hibernate Proxy and how it helps in lazy loading?</h3>
        <p>Hibernate uses proxy object to support lazy loading. Basically when you load data from tables, hibernate doesn’t load all the mapped objects. As soon as you reference a child or lookup object via getter methods, if the linked entity is not in the session cache, then the proxy code will go to the database and load the linked object. It uses javassist to effectively and dynamically generate sub-classed implementations of your entity objects.</p>
        <h3>How to implement relationships in hibernate?</h3>
        <p>We can easily implement one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships in hibernate. It can be done using JPA annotations as well as XML based configurations.</p>
        <h3>How transaction management works in Hibernate?</h3>
        <p>Transaction management is very easy in hibernate because most of the operations are not permitted outside of a transaction. So after getting the session from SessionFactory, we can call session beginTransaction() to start the transaction.</p>
        <h3>What are best practices to follow with Hibernate framework?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always check the primary key field access, if it’s generated at the database layer then you should not have a setter for this.</li>
            <li>By default hibernate set the field values directly, without using setters. So if you want hibernate to use setters, then make sure proper access is defined as @Access(value=AccessType.PROPERTY).</li>
            <li>If access type is property, make sure annotations are used with getter methods and not setter methods. Avoid mixing of using annotations on both filed and getter methods.</li>
            <li>Use native sql query only when it can’t be done using HQL, such as using database specific feature.</li>
            <li>If you have to sort the collection, use ordered list rather than sorting it using Collection API.</li>
            <li>Use named queries wisely, keep it at a single place for easy debugging. Use them for commonly used queries only. For entity specific query, you can keep them in the entity bean itself.</li>
            <li>For web applications, always try to use JNDI DataSource rather than configuring to create connection in hibernate.</li>
            <li>Avoid Many-to-Many relationships, it can be easily implemented using bidirectional One-to-Many and Many-to-One relationships.</li>
            <li>For collections, try to use Lists, maps and sets. Avoid array because you don’t get benefit of lazy loading.</li>
            <li>Do not treat exceptions as recoverable, roll back the Transaction and close the Session. If you do not do this, Hibernate cannot guarantee that in-memory state accurately represents the persistent state.</li>
            <li>Prefer DAO pattern for exposing the different methods that can be used with entity bean</li>
            <li>Prefer lazy fetching for associations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Spring Questions</h2>
        <h3>What is Spring Framework?</h3>
        <p>The Spring Framework uses Dependency Injection and Aspect Oriented Programming to achieve a loose coupling between components and cross-cutting tasks.</p>
        <h3>What are some of the important features of Spring?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight and very little overhead of using framework for our development.</li>
            <li>Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control to write components that are independent of each other, spring container takes care of wiring them together to achieve our work.</li>
            <li>Spring IoC container manages Spring Bean life cycle and project specific configurations such as JNDI lookup.</li>
            <li>Spring MVC framework can be used to create web applications as well as restful web services capable of returning XML as well as JSON response.</li>
            <li>Support for transaction management, JDBC operations, File uploading, Exception Handling etc with very little configurations, either by using annotations or by spring bean configuration file.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What are some advantages of using Spring?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing direct dependencies between different components of the application, usually Spring IoC container is responsible for initializing resources or beans and inject them as dependencies.</li>
            <li>Writing unit test cases are easy in Spring framework because our business logic doesn’t have direct dependencies with actual resource implementation classes. We can easily write a test configuration and inject our mock beans for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>Reduces the amount of boiler-plate code, such as initializing objects, open/close resources. I like JdbcTemplate class a lot because it helps us in removing all the boiler-plate code that comes with JDBC programming.</li>
            <li>Spring framework is divided into several modules, it helps us in keeping our application lightweight. For example, if we don’t need Spring transaction management features, we don’t need to add that dependency on our project.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is Dependency Injection?</h3>
        <p>Dependency Injection design pattern allows us to remove the hard-coded dependencies and make our application loosely coupled, extendable and maintainable.</p>
        <p>We can implement dependency injection pattern to move the dependency resolution from compile-time to runtime.</p>
        <h3>How do we implement DI in Spring?</h3>
        <p>We can use Spring XML and Annotation-based configuration to implement DI in spring applications.</p>
        <h3>What are the benefits of using Spring Tool Suite?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Templates for creating different types of Spring projects.</li>
            <li>It highlights the Spring components and if you are using AOP pointcuts and advice, then it clearly shows which methods will come under the specific pointcut.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Name some of the important Spring Modules?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring Context – for dependency injection.</li>
            <li>Spring AOP – for aspect oriented programming.</li>
            <li>Spring DAO – for database operations using DAO pattern</li>
            <li>Spring JDBC – for JDBC and DataSource support.</li>
            <li>Spring ORM – for ORM tools support such as Hibernate</li>
            <li>Spring Web Module – for creating web applications.</li>
            <li>Spring MVC – Model-View-Controller implementation for creating web applications, web services etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is Aspect Oriented Programming?</h3>
        <p>In Object Oriented Programming, modularity of application is achieved by Classes whereas in AOP application modularity is achieved by Aspects and they are configured to cut across different classes methods.</p>
        <p>AOP takes out the direct dependency of cross-cutting tasks from classes that are not possible in normal object-oriented programming.</p>
        <h3>What is Aspect, Advice, Pointcut, JointPoint and Advice Arguments in AOP?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Aspect: Aspect is a class that implements cross-cutting concerns, such as transaction management.</li>
            <p>Aspects can be a normal class configured and then configured in Spring Bean configuration file or we can use Spring AspectJ support to declare a class as Aspect using @Aspect annotation.</p>
            <li>Advice: Advice is the action taken for a particular join point.</li>
            <p>In terms of programming, they are methods that gets executed when a specific join point with matching pointcut is reached in the application. You can think of Advices as Spring interceptors or Servlet Filters.</p>
            <li>Pointcut: Pointcut are regular expressions that are matched with join points to determine whether advice needs to be executed or not.</li>
            <p>Pointcut uses different kinds of expressions that are matched with the join points. Spring framework uses the AspectJ pointcut expression language for determining the join points where advice methods will be applied.</p>
            <li>Join Point: A join point is a specific point in the application such as method execution, exception handling, changing object variable values etc. In Spring AOP a join point is always the execution of a method.</li><br>
            <li>Advice Arguments: We can pass arguments in the advice methods.</li>
            <p>We can use args() expression in the pointcut to be applied to any method that matches the argument pattern. If we use this, then we need to use the same name in the advice method from where the argument type is determined.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is the difference between Spring AOP and AspectJ AOP?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring AOP is simpler to use than AspectJ because we don’t need to worry about the weaving process.</li>
            <li>Spring AOP supports AspectJ annotations, so if you are familiar with AspectJ then working with Spring AOP is easier.</li>
            <li>Spring AOP supports only proxy-based AOP, so it can be applied only to method execution join points. AspectJ support all kinds of pointcuts.</li>
            <li>One of the shortcomings of Spring AOP is that it can be applied only to the beans created through Spring Context.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is Spring IoC Container?</h3>
        <p>Inversion of Control (IoC) is the mechanism to achieve loose-coupling between Objects dependencies. To achieve loose coupling and dynamic binding of the objects at runtime, the objects define their dependencies that are being injected by other assembler objects. Spring IoC container is the program that injects dependencies into an object and makes it ready for our use.</p>
        <p>Some of the useful ApplicationContext implementations that we use are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>AnnotationConfigApplicationContext: For standalone java applications using annotations based configuration.</li>
            <li>ClassPathXmlApplicationContext: For standalone java applications using XML based configuration.</li>
            <li>FileSystemXmlApplicationContext: Similar to ClassPathXmlApplicationContext except that the xml configuration file can be loaded from anywhere in the file system.</li>
            <li>AnnotationConfigWebApplicationContext and XmlWebApplicationContext for web applications.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is a Spring Bean?</h3>
        <p>Any normal java class that is initialized by Spring IoC container is called Spring Bean. We use Spring ApplicationContext to get the Spring Bean instance.</p>
        <p>Spring IoC container manages the life cycle of Spring Bean, bean scopes and injecting any required dependencies in the bean.</p>
        <h3>What is the importance of the Spring bean configuration file?</h3>
        <p>We use Spring Bean configuration file to define all the beans that will be initialized by Spring Context. When we create the instance of Spring ApplicationContext, it reads the spring bean XML file and initializes all of them. Once the context is initialized, we can use it to get different bean instances.</p>
        <h3>What are the different ways to configure a class as Spring Bean?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>XML Configuration: This is the most popular configuration and we can use bean element in context file to configure a Spring Bean.</li>
            <li>Java Based Configuration: If you are using only annotations, you can configure a Spring bean using @Bean annotation. This annotation is used with @Configuration classes to configure a spring bean.</li>
            <li>Annotation Based Configuration: We can also use @Component, @Service, @Repository and @Controller annotations with classes to configure them to be as spring bean. For these, we would need to provide base package location to scan for these classes.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What are different scopes of Spring Bean?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>singleton: Only one instance of the bean will be created for each container. This is the default scope for the spring beans.</li>
            <li>prototype: A new instance will be created every time the bean is requested.</li>
            <li>request: This is same as prototype scope, however it’s meant to be used for web applications. A new instance of the bean will be created for each HTTP request.</li>
            <li>session: A new bean will be created for each HTTP session by the container.</li>
            <li>global-session: This is used to create global session beans for Portlet applications.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is Spring Bean life cycle?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Spring Beans are initialized by Spring Container.</li>
            <li>The dependencies are injected.</li>
            <li>When the context is destroyed, it also destroys all the initialized beans.</li>
            <p>We also have post processing methods that occur when creating or destroying a bean.</p>
            <p>Implementing InitializingBean and DisposableBean interfaces or using init-method and destroy-method attribute in spring bean configurations.</p>
        </ol>
        <h3>How we get ServletContext and ServletConfig objects in a Spring Bean?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Implementing Spring *Aware interfaces, for these ServletContextAware and ServletConfigAware interfaces.</li>
            <li>Using @Autowired annotation with bean variable of type ServletContext and ServletConfig.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>What is Bean wiring and @Autowired annotation?</h3>
        <p>The process of injection spring bean dependencies while initializing it called Spring Bean Wiring.</p>
        <p>Usually, it’s best practice to do the explicit wiring of all the bean dependencies, but the spring framework also supports auto-wiring. We can use @Autowired annotation with fields or methods for autowiring byType. For this annotation to work, we also need to enable annotation-based configuration in spring bean configuration file. This can be done by context:annotation-config element.</p>
        <h3>What are different types of Spring Bean autowiring?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>autowire byName</li>
            <li>autowire byType</li>
            <li>autowire by constructor</li>
            <li>autowiring by @Autowired and @Qualifier annotations</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Does Spring Bean provide thread safety?</h3>
        <p>The default scope of Spring bean is singleton, so there will be only one instance per context.</p>
        <p>That means that all the having a class level variable that any thread can update will lead to inconsistent data. Hence in default mode spring beans are not thread-safe.</p>
