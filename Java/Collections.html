<div class="content">
    <h2>Collections Framework</h2>
    <p>The collections framework was designed to meet several goals.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The framework had to be high-performance. The implementations for the fundamental collections (dynamic arrays, linked lists, trees, and hashtables) were to be highly efficient.</li>
        <li>The framework had to allow different types of collections to work in a similar manner and with a high degree of interoperability.</li>
        <li>The framework had to extend and/or adapt a collection easily.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. All collections frameworks contain the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Interfaces</b> − These are abstract data types that represent collections. Interfaces allow collections to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. In object-oriented languages, interfaces generally form a hierarchy.</li>
        <li><b>Implementations, i.e., Classes</b> − These are the concrete implementations of the collection interfaces. In essence, they are reusable data structures.</li>
        <li><b>Algorithms</b> − These are the methods that perform useful computations, such as searching and sorting, on objects that implement collection interfaces. The algorithms are said to be polymorphic: that is, the same method can be used on many different implementations of the appropriate collection interface.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to collections, the framework defines several map interfaces and classes. Maps store key/value pairs. Although maps are not collections in the proper use of the term, but they are fully integrated with collections.</p>
    <h3>The Collection Interfaces</h3>
    <div class="scrollableTable"><table>
        <tr>
            <th>Interface</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>The Collection Interface</td>
            <td>This enables you to work with groups of objects; it is at the top of the collections hierarchy.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>List</td>
            <td>This extends Collection and an instance of List stores an ordered collection of elements.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Set</td>
            <td>This extends Collection to handle sets, which must contain unique elements.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>SortedSet</td>
            <td>This extends Set to handle sorted sets.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Map</td>
            <td>This maps unique keys to values.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Map.Entry</td>
            <td>This describes an element (a key/value pair) in a map. This is an inner class of Map.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sorted Map</td>
            <td>This extends Map so that the keys are maintained in an ascending order.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Enumeration</td>
            <td>This is a legacy interface defines the methods by which you can enumerate (obtain one at a time) the elements in a collection of objects. This legacy interface has been superceded by Iterator.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    </div>
    <h3>The Collection Classes</h3>
    <p>Java provides a set of standard collection classes that implement Collection interfaces. Some of the classes provide full implementations that can be used as-is and others are abstract class, providing skeletal implementations that are used as starting points for creating concrete collections.</p>
