# Austin-Krieger.GITHUB.IO
This was initially created as a website for storing my notes on Java, but it has evolved into a storage site for my notes on web and game development languages such as JavaScript, SQL, Roblox (Lua), Unity (C#) and any other language or subject matter I would like to store notes on. I also have some error fixes with corresponding screenshots, for example: 
"how to fix port and authentication issues when installing Xampp" and "how to remove birthday notifications from hotmail".
