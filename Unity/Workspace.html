        <h2>Unity Editor Interface</h2>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/UnityEditorInterface.jpg" alt="Unity Workspace Image"></div>
        <h2>Project Window</h2>
        <p>The Project window lists all the files and directories in your current Project. These files include all the images, sounds, 3D models and other items used in your Project. They are collectively known as Assets.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/ProjectWindow.jpg" alt="Project Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Console Window</h2>
        <p>The Console window shows you the warnings and errors that your game is producing, and can give you useful information for fixing those errors. By default, the Console window tab is next to the Project window tab. You can move it by dragging and dropping the Console tab to dock the window next to the Project window.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/ConsoleWindow.jpg" alt="Console Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Hierarchy Window</h2>
        <p>In Unity, games are made up of Scenes (Levels). Within every Scene, you have a list of objects that have a place within that Scene (The characters &amp; environment objects). These objects are called GameObjects in Unity.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/HierarchyWindow.jpg" alt="Hierarchy Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Scene View</h2>
        <p>The Scene view is a live preview window. It shows your currently loaded Scenes and all the GameObjects in the Hierarchy window. You can use this window to place and move GameObjects in your Scene. Clicking on a GameObject in the Scene view will highlight it in the Hierarchy window.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/SceneView.jpg" alt="Scene View Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Game Window</h2>
        <p>The Game view is hidden as a tab next to the Scene view by default. While the Scene view allows you to move GameObjects and look around your entire Scene, the Game view shows you what the player will see when they play the game. This is determined by what the camera in your Scene is looking at.</p>
        <p>Currently there is nothing visible in the Scene, so you canâ€™t see anything in the example image.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/GameWindow.jpg" alt="Scene View Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Inspector Window</h2>
        <p>When you select a GameObject in another window, the Inspector window will display all of the data relating to that object. Unity uses an Object - Component model, which means that you can add different components to GameObjects to change their features. For example, a Camera component allows the player to have a view into the scene.</p>
        <p>All GameObjects start with a Transform component that allows you to specify their position and rotation in the Scene. Other components are optional and you can add them as needed.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/InspectorWindow.jpg" alt="Inspector Window Image"></div>

    <button class="collapsible">Toolbar and NAvigation UI</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">The Toolbar</h2>
        <p>The toolbar includes a range of useful tool buttons to help you design and test your game.</p>
        <div style="width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/Toolbar.jpg" alt="Toolbar Image" style="height: 40px;"></div><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Play buttons</h2>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/PlayButtons.jpg" alt="Play Buttons Image" style="max-height: 40px;"></div>
        <h3>Play</h3>
        <p>Play is used to test the Scene which is currently loaded in the Hierarchy window, and enables you to try out your game live in the Editor.</p>
        <h3>Pause</h3>
        <p>Pause allows you to pause the game playing in the Game window. This helps you spot visual problems or gameplay issues that you wouldn't otherwise see.</p>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>Step is used to walk through the paused scene frame by frame. This works well when you're looking for live changes in the game world that it would be helpful to see in real time.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Manipulating Objects</h2>
        <p>These tools move and manipulate the GameObjects in the Scene window. You can click on the buttons to activate them, or use a shortcut key.</p>

        <h2>Scale Tool</h2>
        <p>This tool is used to scale your GameObjects up and down.</p>
        <img src="../images/UnityImages/RectTransformTool.jpg" alt="Rect Transform Tool Image" style="max-height: 20px; float: left; position: relative; top: 7px; padding-right: 5px;">
        <h2>Rect Transform Tool</h2>
        <p>This tool combines moving, scaling and rotation into a single tool that's specialized for 2D and UI.</p>
        <img src="../images/UnityImages/RotateMoveScale.jpg" alt="Rotate, Move or Scale Tool Image" style="max-height: 20px; float: left; position: relative; top: 7px; padding-right: 5px;">
        <h2>Rotate, Move or Scale</h2>
        <p>This tool also enables you to move, rotate, or scale GameObjects, but is more specialized for 3D.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Shortcuts</h2>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Shortcut F</h2><p>Enables you to focus on a selected object. If you forget where a GameObject is in you Scene, just select it in the Hierarchy, move your cursor over to the Scene window, and press F to center it in the Scene window.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Navigating with the mouse</h2>
        <p>When you're in the Scene window, you can also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Left click to select your GameObject in the Scene.</li>
            <li>Middle click and drag to move the Scene view's camera using the hand tool.</li>
            <li>Right click and drag to rotate the Scene view's camera using flythrough mode - a variation on the hand tool. While doing this, you can also move the camera left and right using A and D, forward and back using W and S, and down and up using Q and E.</li>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Default Layouts</h2>
        <p>You can lay out your Editor in several ways. Each layout has its own advantages and you'll find out which layout works best for you.</p>
        <p>To switch layouts, select Windows > Layouts (or use the Layouts drop-down menu in the top right corner of the Editor). You can choose from the following layouts:</p>
        <h3>2 by 3</h3>
        <p>This layout lets you see both your Scene view and Game view together with your Inspector, Project view and Hierarchy in columns to the right.</p>
        <h3>4 Split</h3>
        <p>This layout is good for looking at 3D models from different angles.</p>
        <h3>Tall</h3>
        <p>This layout makes the Scene view and Inspector nice and clear.</p>
        <h3>Wide</h3>
        <p>This layout pushes the Hierarchy, Project window and Assets to the bottom of the Editor.</p>
        <h3>Default</h3>
        <p>This layout makes your Scene or Game view take up most of the Editor, and there's also room for your Assets, Hierarchy and Inspector on either side.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Save the Scene</h2>
        <p>When a new Project is created, Unity automatically creates an empty Scene called "Untitled".</p>
        <div class="center" style="padding: 10px; max-width: 500px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/HierarchyWindow.jpg" alt="Untitle Scene Image"></div>
        <p>Go to <b>File > Save</b> or press <b>Ctrl/Cmd + S</b>, then select where you want to save the file. A folder named Scenes is generally used, so let's save this Scene in that folder as "MainScene".</p>
        <p>You will see this creates a Scene Asset called MainScene in the Project window.</p>
        <div class="center" style="padding: 10px; max-width: 400px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/MainScene.jpg" alt="Main Scene Image"></div>
        <p>You now have a Scene to work in. Remember to press <b>Ctrl/Cmd + S</b> regularly to save your changes. <b>"Save early, Save often!"</b>.</p>
    </div>
    &nbsp;
    <button class="collapsible">Add a Character Model</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Adding a Character Model</h2>
        <p>Import a character model from your own files or from the asset store.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Project window, go to the <b>Assets > Models > Characters</b> folder and find the model you wish to add to your Scene.</li>
            <li>Drag the model from the Project window into the Scene view. This enables you to choose exactly where you want to place the model. (You can also drag models into the Hierarchy to create GameObjects at the default position.)</li>
            <li>With your cursor over the Scene view, press <b>F</b> to focus.<p>You should now see the model in the scene!</p></li>
            <li>In the Hierarchy window, find the GameObject. If there is an arrow next to the name of the GameObject - this means that the GameObject has children.</li>
            <li>Click on the arrow to expand and see its children.</li>
            <p>Select the child GameObject with the same name as your character. This GameObject should have a component called a <b>Skinned Mesh Renderer.</b>. This is what enables you to see the character.</p>
            <p>Models are made up of a mesh of triangles, and a Mesh Renderer "renders" that mesh so you can see it. A Skinned Mesh Renderer is a special type of Mesh Renderer that allows the mesh to change shape based on the positions and rotations of all of a modelâ€™s bones. These bones are child GameObjects of the model. The characters bones are all children of the Root GameObject.</p>
            <li>In the Hierarchy, select the <b>Root</b> GameObject. Hold alt/Option and click the arrow to the left of its name to expand all its child GameObjects. Each of these GameObjects represents a part of the character's body (RightLeg/Hips/Spine/Neck/LeftShoulder/etc.)</li>
            <li>In the Hierarchy, select the GameObject called LeftForeArm. In its Transform component, find the Rotation field and change the Y value to 90. You will see that the left arm has bent 90 degrees.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px; max-width: 500px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/LeftForearm.jpg" alt="Left Forearm Transform Image"></div>
            <p>The Animator component on the character's parent GameObject will change the rotation of all the bone GameObject Tranform components, and these changes will happen together to animate the character.</p>
            <li>Collapse all the GameObjects again by holding alt/Option and clicking the arrow next to the name of the parent GameObject.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    &nbsp;
    <button class="collapsible">Prefabs</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">What are Prefabs?</h2>
        <p>Prefabs are a special type of Asset that represent a GameObject or collection of GameObjects with components that are already set up. They're like a blueprint which you can use to easily make instances of the same thing. Each instance of a prefab is linked to the Prefab Asset, so changing the Asset will change all versions of the Prefab in all Scenes. This also means that if you go on to make mulitple level for a game, you won't need to remake a character for every level - you can just instantiate a new Prefab.</p>
        <p>Prefabs can be identified in the Hierarchy by their blue name and icon:</p>
        <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/Prefab.jpg" alt="Prefab Image" style="max-height: 100px;"></div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Making a Prefab</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Drag the GameObject from the Hierarchy into the <b>Assets > Prefab</b> folder in the Project window. A dialogue box will appear asking if you want to make an Original Prefab or a Prefab Variant - select <b>Original Prefab</b>.</li>
            <p>Dragging a GameObject like this makes it a Prefab regardless of the folder it is dragged into. Best practice would be to place them in a folder named Prefabs.</p>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/PrefabDialogueBox.JPG" alt="Prefab Dialogue Box Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
            <li>Now the Prefab has been created, any changes you make will be reflected on the instance of the GameObject in the Scene. In order to make changes to a Prefab, you will need to open the Prefab for editing in Prefab Mode.</li>
            <li>Click on the Prefab and in the Inspector window you will see a button that reads "Open Prefab". Clicking on this button will put the Unity Editor in Prefab Mode.</li>
            <p>This mode takes you out of your current Scene and puts you in a temporary Scene with just the Prefab. The Scene has changed slighlty; at the top there is a new bar with <b>Scenes | Prefab Name</b> on the left and a checkbox labeled Auto Save on the right.</p>
            <li>Disable the <b>Auto Save</b> checkbox. A Save button will appear so you can manually save any changes that you make to the Prefab.</li>
            <li>The Hierarchy window also has a new bar at the top. The arrow on the left will take you back along the breadcrumn. If you clicked it now, it would take you back to MainScene.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    &nbsp;
    <button class="collapsible">Animate your character</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Animating your character</h2>
        <p>Two important animations to have for your player character are a walking animation and an idle animation for when the player is walking and not walking respectively.</p>
        <p>Select your player character GameObject and take a look at its Animator component in the Inspector. The first property is called Controller. This takes a reference to a type of Asset called an Animator Controller, which your're going to use to get the characer moving.</p>
        <p>Animator Controllers contain a <b>state machine</b> which determines what animation the Animator component should be setting for its hierarchy at any given time. This animation is based on animation clips which have been set up on the Animator Controller.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Create the Animator Controller</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Project Window, find the <b>Assets > Animation > Animators</b> folder. Right click on it and select <b>Create > Animator Controller</b>.</li>
            <li>Name the Animator Controller, then double click on it to open it for editing in the Animator window.</li>
            <p>The Animator window has two main sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A panel for editing Animator Layers and Animator Parameters on the left.</li>
                <li>An area which displays the state machine itself on the right.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Click the <b>Parameters</b> tab on the top left of the Animator window.</li>
            <p>The Animator Controller's state machine makes decisions based on the current values of its <b>Animator Parameters</b>. These Animator Parameters have values set by script. You will need one parameter for every independent variable which can affect the animation that the character is playing.</p>
            <p>There are four types of parameter:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A <b>float</b> parameter has the value of a floating point variable (a number with a decimal place).</li>
                <li>An <b>int</b> parameter has the value of an integer (a number without a decimal place).</li>
                <li>A <b>bool</b> parameter has the value of a boolean (which can be true or false).</li>
                <li>A <b>trigger</b> parameter is a special type of parameter which doesn't hold a value - this causes a change from one animation to another.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In this case, you know that the character is either walking or stationary, so a bool parameter makes the most sense.</p>
            <li>Click the <b>+</b> button and select <b>Bool</b> from the drop-down to create a new Bool Animator Parameter.</li>
            <li>Name the new Animator Parameter "IsWalking". The spelling and capitalisation is important for the scripting later.</li>
            <p>This is the default value for the parameter.  Without player input your character is going to be stationary, so IsWalking should be false. This means you donâ€™t need to change anything here.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Set Up the Animations</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Project window, go to the <b>Assets > Animation > Animation</b> window.</li><p>A slider on the bottom right can change the folder from icon view to list view.</p>
            <li>The list of animations should have a naming convention such as "PlayerCharacter@Idle", "PlayerCharacter@Walk" and so on.</li>
            <li>In order to use these animations in your Animator Controller, drag them from the Project window to the Animator window. Start with Idle.</li>
            <li>Animations exist in an Animator Controller in <b>Animator States</b>. When you dragged in the Idle and Walkanimations, the Animator Controller created two states containing them and named them after the animations.</li>
            <p>An Animator State is part of the state machine that an Animator Controller contains. The state machine contains logic which determines which state is the current state. The current state then determines the animation that is being played.</p>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/AnimatorDefaultState.jpg" alt="Animator Default State Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
            <p>The default state is displayed in orange (Idle). Your state machine now has two states in it, but no logic to define which state should play. Currently, the state machine will start in the default state and never change, so the character will always be idle. We will need to make <b>Animator Transitions</b>.</p>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Create Animator Transitions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Right click on the Idle state and select <b>Make Transition</b>. This starts a transition that follows the mouse cursor.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/AnimatorDefaultState.jpg" alt="Make Transition Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
            <p>To finish creating the transition, click on the Walk state.</p>
            <li>Your character needs to be able to change back to idle from walking, so repeat this process to create a trainsition from Walk to Idle.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/Transition.JPG" alt="Transition Image" style="max-height: 200px;"></div>
            <li>The state machine now has a way of transitioning between the two animations, but it doesn't yet know when to transition. Select the transition from Idle to Walk by clicking on the connecting line.</li>
            <li>In the inspector, look at the settings from this transition. The first thing you need to change is the <b>Has Exit Time checkbox</b>.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/HasExitTime.JPG" alt="Has Exit Time Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
            <p>If Has Exit Time is true (the checkbox is enabled) then after a certain amount of time has passed the transition will automatically be taken and the state machine will play the next state. So, <b>disable</b> the <b>Has Exit Time checkbox</b>.</p>
            <p>You will now see a warning, because there is no longer a reason to ever take this transition. We need to provide one by adding a <b>Condition</b>.</p>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/ConditionsWarning.JPG" alt="Condition Warning Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Add Conditions to your Transition</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Click the <b>+</b> button beneath the (currently empty) Conditions list.</li>
            <li>The transition from Idle to Walk is required when the character is walking - that is, when <b>IsWalking</b> is true.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px; max-width: 500px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/IsWalkingCondition.JPG" alt="Is Walking Condition Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
            <p>Next, you need to set up the transition from Walk to Idle.</p>
            <li>Select the transition from <b>Walk to Idle</b> in the Animator window. <b>Disable</b> the <b>Has Exit Time checkbox</b> - as before, you don't want the state to change after a certain amount of time, just when you want it to.</li>
            <li>Now that the Has Exit Time checkbox is disabled, you need to create another Condition.</li>
            <p>This Condition should also check IsWalking, but this time the value should be set as false.  If the character is not walking then it should transition from Walk to Idle.</p>
