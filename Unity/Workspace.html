        <h2>Unity Editor Interface</h2>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/UnityEditorInterface.jpg" alt="Unity Workspace Image"></div>
        <h2>Project Window</h2>
        <p>The Project window lists all the files and directories in your current Project. These files include all the images, sounds, 3D models and other items used in your Project. They are collectively known as Assets.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/ProjectWindow.jpg" alt="Project Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Console Window</h2>
        <p>The Console window shows you the warnings and errors that your game is producing, and can give you useful information for fixing those errors. By default, the Console window tab is next to the Project window tab. You can move it by dragging and dropping the Console tab to dock the window next to the Project window.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/ConsoleWindow.jpg" alt="Console Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Hierarchy Window</h2>
        <p>In Unity, games are made up of Scenes (Levels). Within every Scene, you have a list of objects that have a place within that Scene (The characters &amp; environment objects). These objects are called GameObjects in Unity.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/HierarchyWindow.jpg" alt="Hierarchy Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Scene View</h2>
        <p>The Scene view is a live preview window. It shows your currently loaded Scenes and all the GameObjects in the Hierarchy window. You can use this window to place and move GameObjects in your Scene. Clicking on a GameObject in the Scene view will highlight it in the Hierarchy window.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/SceneView.jpg" alt="Scene View Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Game Window</h2>
        <p>The Game view is hidden as a tab next to the Scene view by default. While the Scene view allows you to move GameObjects and look around your entire Scene, the Game view shows you what the player will see when they play the game. This is determined by what the camera in your Scene is looking at.</p>
        <p>Currently there is nothing visible in the Scene, so you can’t see anything in the example image.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/GameWindow.jpg" alt="Scene View Window Image"></div>
        <h2>Inspector Window</h2>
        <p>When you select a GameObject in another window, the Inspector window will display all of the data relating to that object. Unity uses an Object - Component model, which means that you can add different components to GameObjects to change their features. For example, a Camera component allows the player to have a view into the scene.</p>
        <p>All GameObjects start with a Transform component that allows you to specify their position and rotation in the Scene. Other components are optional and you can add them as needed.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/InspectorWindow.jpg" alt="Inspector Window Image"></div>

    <button class="collapsible">Toolbar and NAvigation UI</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">The Toolbar</h2>
        <p>The toolbar includes a range of useful tool buttons to help you design and test your game.</p>
        <div style="width: 100%; overflow-x: scroll;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/Toolbar.jpg" alt="Toolbar Image" style="height: 40px;"></div><br>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Play buttons</h2>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/PlayButtons.jpg" alt="Play Buttons Image" style="max-height: 40px;"></div>
        <h3>Play</h3>
        <p>Play is used to test the Scene which is currently loaded in the Hierarchy window, and enables you to try out your game live in the Editor.</p>
        <h3>Pause</h3>
        <p>Pause allows you to pause the game playing in the Game window. This helps you spot visual problems or gameplay issues that you wouldn't otherwise see.</p>
        <h3>Step</h3>
        <p>Step is used to walk through the paused scene frame by frame. This works well when you're looking for live changes in the game world that it would be helpful to see in real time.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Manipulating Objects</h2>
        <p>These tools move and manipulate the GameObjects in the Scene window. You can click on the buttons to activate them, or use a shortcut key.</p>
        <div class="center"><img src="../images/UnityImages/ManipulatingObjects.jpg" alt="Manipulating Objects Image" style="max-height: 40px;"></div>

        <h2>Scale Tool</h2>
        <p>This tool is used to scale your GameObjects up and down.</p>
        <img src="../images/UnityImages/RectTransformTool.jpg" alt="Rect Transform Tool Image" style="max-height: 20px; float: left; position: relative; top: 7px; padding-right: 5px;">
        <h2>Rect Transform Tool</h2>
        <p>This tool combines moving, scaling and rotation into a single tool that's specialized for 2D and UI.</p>
        <img src="../images/UnityImages/RotateMoveScale.jpg" alt="Rotate, Move or Scale Tool Image" style="max-height: 20px; float: left; position: relative; top: 7px; padding-right: 5px;">
        <h2>Rotate, Move or Scale</h2>
        <p>This tool also enables you to move, rotate, or scale GameObjects, but is more specialized for 3D.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Shortcuts</h2>

            </div>
        </div>
        <h2>Shortcut F</h2><p>Enables you to focus on a selected object. If you forget where a GameObject is in you Scene, just select it in the Hierarchy, move your cursor over to the Scene window, and press F to center it in the Scene window.</p>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Navigating with the mouse</h2>
        <p>When you're in the Scene window, you can also:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Left click to select your GameObject in the Scene.</li>
            <li>Middle click and drag to move the Scene view's camera using the hand tool.</li>
            <li>Right click and drag to rotate the Scene view's camera using flythrough mode - a variation on the hand tool. While doing this, you can also move the camera left and right using A and D, forward and back using W and S, and down and up using Q and E.</li>

    <button class="collapsible">Layouts</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Default Layouts</h2>
        <p>You can lay out your Editor in several ways. Each layout has its own advantages and you'll find out which layout works best for you.</p>
        <p>To switch layouts, select Windows > Layouts (or use the Layouts drop-down menu in the top right corner of the Editor). You can choose from the following layouts:</p>
        <h3>2 by 3</h3>
        <p>This layout lets you see both your Scene view and Game view together with your Inspector, Project view and Hierarchy in columns to the right.</p>
        <h3>4 Split</h3>
        <p>This layout is good for looking at 3D models from different angles.</p>
        <h3>Tall</h3>
        <p>This layout makes the Scene view and Inspector nice and clear.</p>
        <h3>Wide</h3>
        <p>This layout pushes the Hierarchy, Project window and Assets to the bottom of the Editor.</p>
        <h3>Default</h3>
        <p>This layout makes your Scene or Game view take up most of the Editor, and there's also room for your Assets, Hierarchy and Inspector on either side.</p>

    <button class="collapsible">Creating a Project</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Creating a Project</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the Unity Hub.</li>
            <li>Log in with your Unity account.</li>
            <li>Click the New button in the top right corner.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/UnityHub.JPG" alt="Unity Hub Image"></div>
            <li>Enter a Project name.</li>
            <li>Set the Unity Version.</li>
            <li>Choose the folder where you want to save your Project.</li>
            <li>Choose your Template (2D/3D)</li>
            <li>Click Create project.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/NewProject.JPG" alt="Unity New Project Image"></div>

        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Save the Scene</h2>
        <p>When a new Project is created, Unity automatically creates an empty Scene called "Untitled".</p>
        <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/HierarchyWindow.jpg" alt="Untitle Scene Image"></div>
        <p>Go to <b>File > Save</b> or press <b>Ctrl/Cmd + S</b>, then select where you want to save the file. A folder named Scenes is generally used, so let's save this Scene in that folder as "MainScene".</p>
        <p>You will see this creates a Scene Asset called MainScene in the Project window.</p>
        <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/MainScene.jpg" alt="Main Scene Image"></div>
        <p>You now have a Scene to work in. Remember to press <b>Ctrl/Cmd + S</b> regularly to save your changes. <b>"Save early, Save often!"</b>.</p>
    </div>
    &nbsp;
    <button class="collapsible">Add a Character Model</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Adding a Character Model</h2>
        <p>Import a character model from your own files or from the asset store.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>In the Project window, go to the <b>Assets > Models > Characters</b> folder and find the model you wish to add to your Scene.</li>
            <li>Drag the model from the Project window into the Scene view. This enables you to choose exactly where you want to place the model. (You can also drag models into the Hierarchy to create GameObjects at the default position.)</li>
            <li>With your cursor over the Scene view, press <b>F</b> to focus.<p>You should now see the model in the scene!</p></li>
            <li>In the Hierarchy window, find the GameObject. If there is an arrow next to the name of the GameObject - this means that the GameObject has children.</li>
            <li>Click on the arrow to expand and see its children.</li>
            <p>Select the child GameObject with the same name as your character. This GameObject should have a component called a <b>Skinned Mesh Renderer.</b>. This is what enables you to see the character.</p>
            <p>Models are made up of a mesh of triangles, and a Mesh Renderer "renders" that mesh so you can see it. A Skinned Mesh Renderer is a special type of Mesh Renderer that allows the mesh to change shape based on the positions and rotations of all of a model’s bones. These bones are child GameObjects of the model. The characters bones are all children of the Root GameObject.</p>
            <li>In the Hierarchy, select the <b>Root</b> GameObject. Hold alt/Option and click the arrow to the left of its name to expand all its child GameObjects. Each of these GameObjects represents a part of the character's body (RightLeg/Hips/Spine/Neck/LeftShoulder/etc.)</li>
            <li>In the Hierarchy, select the GameObject called LeftForeArm. In its Transform component, find the Rotation field and change the Y value to 90. You will see that the left arm has bent 90 degrees.</li>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/LeftForearm.jpg" alt="Left Forearm Transform Image"></div>
            <p>The Animator component on the character's parent GameObject will change the rotation of all the bone GameObject Tranform components, and these changes will happen together to animate the character.</p>
            <li>Collapse all the GameObjects again by holding alt/Option and clicking the arrow next to the name of the parent GameObject.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    &nbsp;
    <button class="collapsible">Prefabs</button>
    <div class="content" style="max-width: 1200px; background: #d6d6d6; margin: auto; box-shadow: 1px 1px 1px 4px #c8c8c8 inset;">
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">What are Prefabs?</h2>
        <p>Prefabs are a special type of Asset that represent a GameObject or collection of GameObjects with components that are already set up. They're like a blueprint which you can use to easily make instances of the same thing. Each instance of a prefab is linked to the Prefab Asset, so changing the Asset will change all versions of the Prefab in all Scenes. This also means that if you go on to make mulitple level for a game, you won't need to remake a character for every level - you can just instantiate a new Prefab.</p>
        <p>Prefabs can be identified in the Hierarchy by their blue name and icon:</p>
        <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/Prefab.jpg" alt="Prefab Image" style="max-height: 100px;"></div>
        <h2 style="text-align: center; background-color: #c8c8c8; border-top: 2px solid #555; border-bottom: 2px solid #555;">Making a Prefab</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Drag the GameObject from the Hierarchy into the <b>Assets > Prefab</b> folder in the Project window. A dialogue box will appear asking if you want to make an Original Prefab or a Prefab Variant - select <b>Original Prefab</b>.</li>
            <p>Dragging a GameObject like this makes it a Prefab regardless of the folder it is dragged into. Best practice would be to place them in a folder named Prefabs.</p>
            <div class="center" style="padding: 10px;"><img src="../images/UnityImages/PrefabDialogueBox.JPG" alt="Prefab Dialogue Box Image" style="max-height: 150px;"></div>
            <li>Now the Prefab has been created, any changes you make will be reflected on the instance of the GameObject in the Scene. In order to make changes to a Prefab, you will need to open the Prefab for editing in Prefab Mode.</li>
            <li>Click on the Prefab and in the Inspector window you will see a button that reads "Open Prefab". Clicking on this button will put the Unity Editor in Prefab Mode.</li>
            <p>This mode takes you out of your current Scene and puts you in a temporary Scene with just the Prefab. The Scene has changed slighlty; at the top there is a new bar with <b>Scenes | Prefab Name</b> on the left and a checkbox labeled Auto Save on the right.</p>
            <li>Disable the <b>Auto Save</b> checkbox. A Save button will appear so you can manually save any changes that you make to the Prefab.</li>
            <li>The Hierarchy window also has a new bar at the top. The arrow on the left will take you back along the breadcrumn. If you clicked it now, it would take you back to MainScene.</li>
