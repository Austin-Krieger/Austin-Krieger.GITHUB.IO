                <p>I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Game Design from Dakota State University (DSU), an Associate of Applied Science Degree in Computer Information Systems: Programming Specialist Option from Lake Area Technical Institute (LATI) as well as their Visual Communications Specialist Option. While attending DSU I worked on 2 separate year long game development projects on teams of 6 or more using Agile Development Methodologies and a game engine of our choice (usually Unity). I have 3 years of IT Support Desk Experience as a work-study at the DSU Support Desk, fitting 8 hours behind the desk into my busy class schedule per week. I assisted students and faculty with computer related issues, repaired Fujitsu Tablet PC's, answered the support desk phone and performed other IT related tasks upon request on and off the job. During my internship at LATI I developed a web application for evaluating medical lab technician students undergoing clinicals. I made two forms with upwards of 70 questions on student performance, each having JavaScript controlled sliders, radio buttons, and comment boxes; some of which would only appear based on the grade given to the student. The grade for each evaluation was calculated and displayed in real-time by section and overall. Upon submitting the form, the database would be updated, and the application would then email the results of the evaluation to the professors. After graduating from DSU I took part in a 12-week training program located in Frisco, Texas which covered the basics of Java, JavaScript, Servlets, JDBC, Spring (Boot, MVC, Security), JSP, Bootstrap and Object-Oriented Programming. The goal of this training program was to prepare us with the skills required to work as an entry-level full stack java developer. At the same time as the training I began working on a website where I could store my notes from the training and put it online, it can be viewed at <a href="https://austin-krieger.github.io">https://austin-krieger.github.io</a>. I am a quick learner with plenty of initiative which got me through 6 years of college courses with an overall GPA of 3.97 plus the drive to complete a Bachelor of Science degree two entire semeters early. I have exposure to a multitude of software, programming languages, error troubleshooting, and work related tasks and I'm currently looking for on the job experience as a Gameplay Programmer, Web Developer, Software Developer, Technical Support Specialist, or Quality Assurance Tester.</p>

We created various web and desktop applications that could create, read, update, and delete database information as well as some android applications and desktop applications. For my Internship, I worked on projects from LATI, starting with a South Dakota Coupon App, which was a mobile web application hosted on GoDaddy.com that displayed a searchable list of coupons for fast food and grocery store items, another version has since been made. With my internship requirement still incomplete (Hours Spent), I needed another project to work on. After a brief discussion and creating a list of requirements with my clients, I developed a web application for evaluating medical lab technician students undergoing clinicals. I made two forms with upwards of 70 questions on student performance, each having JavaScript controlled sliders, radio buttons, and comment boxes; some of which would only appear based on the grade given to the student.

                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>:  I was tasked with developing the functionality for the game from User Interface to Leaderboard and Point Assignment Systems. Being our first time using Unreal Engine, we decided to work in its Visual Programming system known as Blueprint Scripting. I wired nodes together prototyping and researching new features for the game, such as: Vibration Patterns for when a user physically shakes the phone, assigning specific sounds, images, and point values to the gifts, and some additional accessibility features in case shaking the phone is not the preferred option. On top of this I was appointed the GitHub Admin of the project, merging branches and making sure people committed their latest changes.</dd>

                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: While developing Florida Man, I worked on many features in the game including: Animation Controllers, Eating, Punching, Burping, and Picking up objects. Adding movement and achievement systems were particularly challenging. I prototyped several options such as nav mesh agents, adding force, and simply translating the character in the direction he was looking, all while working on a desired camera functionality. The achievement system needed to display an achievement in the form of a newspaper headline and allow the user to check their progress from a menu, this feature then lead to a timer and speed running by playtesters.</dd>

                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: I developed many of the features and even found a way to test them in real-time by connecting my android device to my computer with the Unity Remote app. Using Android’s accelerometer controls we could control which direction the raindrop fell when the player tilted their phone, colliders could tell us when the player collected another raindrop or hit an obstacle, and touch controls allowed the player to pause, mute, and restart the game. Following this project, the game was mentioned many times when promoting the game design program from a local research expo to an event where middle schoolers are exposed to computer related carriers. The game is currently available to download on <a href="https://challengetheliving.itch.io/stormyskies">itch.io</a>.</dd>

                    <dd><b>Role</b>: Level Designer</dd>
                    <dd><b>Pitch</b>: The old stories speak of Schrodinger’s experiment where he placed a cat into a box with a vial of poison. However, what if his actual experiment was the box itself? In this top down puzzle game, you will navigate through pocket dimensions within Schrodinger’s experiment. Interact with the other test subjects and use the hints they give to uncover the traps that reside in each room. If you are feeling lucky, interact with the butterflies to help or hinder you in your endeavor to escape the box.</dd>
                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: I was the lead level designer on this weekend long project to play as a Cat? or maybe a Ferret? (inside joke) and escape the "Box". I worked with my team of beginner game designers to prototype levels on the white board and recreate said levels on an excel sheet to give to our programmers and artists. We managed to complete the game with a decent number of levels using Game Maker Studio and received some positive reviews from our fellow game jammers and staff alike.</dd>

                    <dd><b>Pitch</b>: Scream your heart out in this 2d platformer using your voice to fight your inner demons to find your inner peace.</dd>
                    <dd>During the 2018 Global Game Jam, I joined the Vocal Mayhem game which due to our exhausted state was posted on the GGJ website as Verbal Mayhem. Over the weekend we made a 2d platformer that players could control by yelling at the computer screen. For example: yelling "FREEZE!" would pause the game and yelling "UNFREEZE" would resume the game. Similarly, you could yell at an elevator to "Ascend" and your player character to "Jump!". We found that the game had an easier time recognizing longer words, and for a game made in 48 hours, I'm amazed by the results.</dd>
                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: I worked mainly on the functionality surrounding the voice commands, meaning our other programmers worked on the voice recognition while I worked on what happened when the game heard the player say Freeze or Jump and so on. I was also responsible for creating the character animator from the sprite sheets our artist created and making a user interface for the game. It became more and more stressful to fix all the bugs and get everything we wanted into the game given the 48 hour time limit and lack of sleep, but in the final minutes we pulled through and had a fun time watching people playtest the game.</dd>

                <p>For my Internship, I worked on projects from LATI, starting with a South Dakota Coupon App, which was a mobile web application hosted on GoDaddy.com that displayed a searchable list of coupons for fast food and grocery store items, another version has since been made. With my internship requirement still incomplete (Hours Spent), I needed another project to work on. After a brief discussion and creating a list of requirements with my clients, I developed a web application for evaluating medical lab technician students undergoing clinicals. I made two forms with upwards of 70 questions on student performance, each having JavaScript controlled sliders, radio buttons, and comment boxes; some of which would only appear based on the grade given to the student. The grade for each evaluation was calculated and displayed in real-time by section and overall. Upon submitting the form, the database would be updated, and the application would then email the results of the evaluation to the professors.</p>

                <dl>
                    <dt><b>Unreal Experience</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>I worked as the main programmer on a "year-long" (2 semester) project called Gift Game in college. It was a mobile game that could be played in a circle of up to 8 people who would pass the phone to the next player after opening or passing on a gift. The gift in the center of the screen would spin constantly like on a turntable, players shook the phone to hear what was in the box and decide if they wanted to open it. The gift within would either add to or subtract from that players' total score and the final scores would be displayed at the end of the game.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Favorite Game of all time and why?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Gears of War 2. I had a lot of fun playing it online with friends and siblings whether it was the campaign, horde mode, or wingman; the guns, graphics, gore, and narrative made the game immensely fun to play.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Favorite Game Genres</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>Stealth, Survival, Real-Time Strategy, Tower Defense, Party games, and Role-playing games.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>What about this job interests you?</b></dt>
                    <dd>I'm always interested in developing new things whether it is a desk for my home office, a webpage to store notes on a subject I am currently researching, or a video game for Android and/or PC devices. I believe your company can provide me with a similarly creative environment to work in and it would be a great opportunity to gain some on the job experience programming and developing.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>How many times a year is missing work acceptable and for what reasons?</b></dt>
                    <dd>That depends on the size of the company and what is being offered to the employees, sick leave can be earned at an average rate of 1 full sick day every 6 weeks or the employer could offer roughly 8 days for the year and another 10 for vacation days. Acceptable reasons for missing work should include: Holiday, Sickness, Family Emergencies, Family Milestones, Mental Health Days, and Funerals.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Do you prefer to work as part of a team or alone?</b></dt>
                    <dd>I enjoy working alone when necessary, but at the entry-level I would prefer to work in a group as I believe much more learning and progress can be accomplished when everyone is working together.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>How do you handle difficult or escalated customers?</b></dt>
                    <dd>When clients have issues, I use a calm tone of voice and educate them about our company’s services and policies. I won't take their anger personally, even if they are verbally abusive. Instead, I sympathize with their position and assure them that we’ll come up with an effective solution for them. I know how frustrating it can get when troubleshooting issues.</dd><br>
                    <dd><mark>"I’m sorry to hear about this issue. If you will please answer a few questions for me, I’m sure that we can resolve it to your satisfaction."</mark></dd><br>
                    <dt><b>If you didn't understand the customer or they were being rude, what would you do?</b></dt>
                    <dd>If I don't understand what they have said and just need some clarification, I will respectfully ask them to repeat themselves, maybe they need to speak slower or more clearly. Involving them in the troubleshooting process is a good practice. I would ask for a detailed description of the problem they are having and what steps they have taken to resolve the issue so far. Walk them through new solutions to try and hopefully resolving their issue without any further escalation.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>If you are not sure what a coworker meant, what would you do?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Ask them to explain what they meant or their intentions in greater detail.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Why should we hire you?</b></dt>
                    <dd><b>Call center</b>: I can empathize with my callers, and I listen carefully and try to resolve issues as simply and effectively as possible. Helping someone resolve an issue that has haunted them for hours or even days is personally rewarding, like the feeling you get when your program works and no longer throws a multitude of errors and exceptions.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Where do you see yourself in the next 12 to 18 months?</b></dt>
                    <dd>I see myself working for the same employer, being established and having grown with the organization. I hope to keep learning and being given the opportunity to prove myself as a valuable team member.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Tell me about yourself</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>I am a quick learner with plenty of initiative that likes to stay organized and go the extra mile on a project. In my 6 years of college experience I have been exposed to several web development technologies and programming languages such as: SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, JQuery, Java and more. I used some of these technologies for my internship at LATI where I created two evaluation forms for their students undergoing clinicals. These forms included 70+ JavaScript controlled sliders, radio buttons, and comment boxes; some of which would only appear based on the grade given to the student. The grade for each evaluation was calculated and displayed in real-time by section and overall. Upon submitting the form, the database would be updated, and the application would then email the results of the evaluation to the professors. Once I got to DSU I started developing mobile games for Android and PC games using Unity and Unreal. After developing the game "Stormy Skies" my team and I were often praised for our implementation of the core experience for the game and it was often used as an example for other courses and promoting the program.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>What would you say is the number one reason why we should hire you for this position?</b></dt>
                    <dd>I am a quick learner with plenty of initiative and drive to go the extra mile on a project.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>What is more important when you organize your projects, quantity or quality? Explain why.</b></dt>
                    <dd>When I'm organizing my personal projects, quality is better than quantity because I want to be able to go back and look at my projects, remember how they work and how I can implement parts of them into other projects quickly and effectively.</dd><br>
                    <dt><b>Student comes to you with a question, what do you do?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Have them explain how their program is working, line-by-line if necessary and ask what they think is the next step.</dd>
                    <dd>Try to help them work their way through the problem and giving assistance when required.</dd>
