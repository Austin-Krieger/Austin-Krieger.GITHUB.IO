                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>:  I was tasked with developing the functionality for the game from User Interface to Leaderboard and Point Assignment Systems. Being our first time using Unreal Engine, we decided to work in its Visual Programming system known as Blueprint Scripting. I wired nodes together prototyping and researching new features for the game, such as: Vibration Patterns for when a user physically shakes the phone, assigning specific sounds, images, and point values to the gifts, and some additional accessibility features in case shaking the phone is not the preferred option. On top of this I was appointed the GitHub Admin of the project, merging branches and making sure people committed their latest changes.</dd>

                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: While developing Florida Man, I worked on many features in the game including: Animation Controllers, Eating, Punching, Burping, and Picking up objects. Adding movement and achievement systems were particularly challenging. I prototyped several options such as nav mesh agents, adding force, and simply translating the character in the direction he was looking, all while working on a desired camera functionality. The achievement system needed to display an achievement in the form of a newspaper headline and allow the user to check their progress from a menu, this feature then lead to a timer and speed running by playtesters.</dd>

                    <dd><b>Core Experience</b>: Using accelerometer controls, guide a raindrop down a windshield, merge with your fellow raindrops, and try to reach the bottom before the windshield wiper comes back.</dd>
                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: I developed many of the features and even found a way to test them in real-time by connecting my android device to my computer with the Unity Remote app. Using Android’s accelerometer controls we could control which direction the raindrop fell when the player tilted their phone, colliders could tell us when the player collected another raindrop or hit an obstacle, and touch controls allowed the player to pause, mute, and restart the game. Following this project, the game was mentioned many times when promoting the game design program from a local research expo to an event where middle schoolers are exposed to computer related carriers. The game is currently available to download on <a href="https://challengetheliving.itch.io/stormyskies">itch.io</a>.</dd>

However, what if his actual experiment was the box itself? In this top down puzzle game, you will navigate through pocket dimensions within Schrodinger’s experiment. Interact with the other test subjects and use the hints they give to uncover the traps that reside in each room. If you are feeling lucky, interact with the butterflies to help or hinder you in your endeavor to escape the box.</dd>

I worked with my team of beginner game designers to prototype levels on the white board and recreate said levels on an excel sheet to give to our programmers and artists. We managed to complete the game with a decent number of levels using Game Maker Studio and received some positive reviews from our fellow game jammers and staff alike.</dd>

                    <dd>During the 2018 Global Game Jam, I joined the Vocal Mayhem game which due to our exhausted state was posted on the GGJ website as Verbal Mayhem. Over the weekend we made a 2d platformer that players could control by yelling at the computer screen. For example: yelling "FREEZE!" would pause the game and yelling "UNFREEZE" would resume the game. Similarly, you could yell at an elevator to "Ascend" and your player character to "Jump!". We found that the game had an easier time recognizing longer words, and for a game made in 48 hours, I'm amazed by the results.</dd>
                    <dd><b>Responsibilities</b>: I worked mainly on the functionality surrounding the voice commands, meaning our other programmers worked on the voice recognition while I worked on what happened when the game heard the player say Freeze or Jump and so on. I was also responsible for creating the character animator from the sprite sheets our artist created and making a user interface for the game. It became more and more stressful to fix all the bugs and get everything we wanted into the game given the 48 hour time limit and lack of sleep, but in the final minutes we pulled through and had a fun time watching people playtest the game.</dd>

                <p>For my Internship, I worked on projects from LATI, starting with a South Dakota Coupon App, which was a mobile web application hosted on GoDaddy.com that displayed a searchable list of coupons for fast food and grocery store items, another version has since been made. With my internship requirement still incomplete, I needed another project to work on. After a brief discussion and creating a list of requirements with my clients, I developed a web application for evaluating medical lab technician students undergoing clinicals. I made two forms with upwards of 70 questions on student performance, each having JavaScript controlled sliders, radio buttons, and comment boxes; some of which would only appear based on the grade given to the student. Upon submitting the form, the database would be updated, and the application would then email the results of the evaluation to the professors.</p>

                    <dt><b>Unreal Experience</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>I worked as the main programmer on a "year-long" (2 semester) project called Gift Game in college. It was a mobile game that could be played in a circle of up to 8 people who would pass the phone to the next player after opening or passing on a gift. The gift in the center of the screen would spin constantly like on a turntable, players shook the phone to hear what was in the box and decide if they wanted to open it. The gift within would either add to or subtract from that players' total score and the final scores would be displayed at the end of the designated number of rounds.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Favorite Game of all time and why?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Gears of War 2 was probably my favorite game. I had a lot of fun playing it with friends and siblings whether it was the campaign, horde, or wingman game modes; the guns, graphics, and gore made the game immensely fun to play.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Favorite Game Genres</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>Stealth, Survival, Real-Time Strategy, Tower Defense, Party games, and Role-playing games.</dd>

                    <dd>I'm always interested in making new things for the web and this sounds like a good opportunity to gain some on the job experience.</dd>
                    <dt><b>How many times a year is missing work acceptable and for what reasons?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Maybe around 5 to 10 days a year of scheduled work days. Illness, Funerals, and Family Emergencies are acceptable reasons for missing work.</dd>
                    <dt><b>What do you think would be a good reason to be absent from work?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Funerals, Severe Weather, and Health Concerns.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Do you prefer to work as part of a team or alone?</b></dt>
                    <dd>- I am willing to work in either form, but as I am entry level, a team or collaborative environment would be nice.</dd>
                    <dd>- I am fine with either, however, working as part of a team would work better for asking for advice on a subject you are less familiar with.</dd>
                    <dt><b>If you didn't understand the customer or they were being rude, what would you do?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Respectfully ask them to repeat themselves, speak slowly or more clearly, start from the beginning.</dd>
                    <dt><b>If you are not sure what a coworker meant, what would you do?</b></dt>
                    <dd>Ask them to explain their idea in more detail.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Where do you see yourself in the next 12 to 18 months?</b></dt>
                    <dd>In a position that allows me to use and develop my skills in programming, web development, or game design.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Why are you interested in joining Electric Pulp</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>I'm interested in joining your team at Electric Pulp. I took various web development courses at Lake Area Technical Institute where I received an Associate's in programming and another in visual communications. We went over the creation of websites using HTML, ASP.Net, CSS, PHP, MS SQL Server, MySQL, JQuery, Photoshop, Visual Studio, After Effects, COBOL, and more. I'm a little out of practice in some of these technologies, but I'm quick to learn/re-learn. After I graduated twice from LATI; I went on to Dakota State University and got a Bachelor's degree in Computer Game Design with my focus being on the software design aspect (Gameplay Programming). At DSU I took various courses in programming (C/C#/Assembly), game development technologies (Inform7, Perlenspiel, Unity, Maya, Unreal Engine), and more. I am always willing to learn new technologies and hope I qualify for what you are looking for in a candidate.</dd>
                    <dt><b>Tell me about yourself</b>:</dt>
                    <dd>- During my college career at Lake Area Technical Institute and Dakota State University I have taken various web development and programming courses involving database and web design using a variety of languages and software. My resume lists many of the technologies I have worked with such as: PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, JQuery, Bootstrap,  Flexbox, Adobe products and more. Beyond the web design I have also worked with game engines such as Unity and Unreal to make small mobile and PC games. I would also like to mention that I have used maya to make a few 3D models which can be viewed on my sketchfab page.</dd>
                    <dd>- I am a quick learner with plenty of initiative that likes to stay organized. I leaned how to use many web development technologies such as: MS SQL Server, MySQL, HTML, CSS, PHP, and more from my courses at Lake Area Technical Institute and used that knowledge to create a couple evaluation forms for their students undergoing clinicals to be evaluated by their supervisors and upon submission the form information is stored in a database and emailed to the professors to look over.</dd>
                    <dt><b>What would you say is the number one reason why we should hire you for this position?</b></dt>
                    <dd>I am a hard worker with plenty of initiative and drive to go the extra mile on a project.</dd>
